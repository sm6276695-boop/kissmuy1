00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.920
Lord Gao,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.880
can I see Jin today?

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.480
She's my daughter.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.960
I won't rest until I see her.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.000
Jin hasn't woken up yet.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.160
Seeing her won't help.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.080
Cooperate properly first.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.240
Wait until she wakes up.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.920
Leave now.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.960
Master Lu.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.880
Why are you here?

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.560
I made you five-red soup.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.480
It's the best
for replenishing your energy.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.880
I-I'm fine.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.920
You call this fine?

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.280
Look how pale you've become.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.080
Come on. Sit down.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.800
If there's anything you want to eat

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.320
or drink these days, let me know.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.664
I'll make it all for you.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.720
Come on.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.720
How is it?

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.480
What's wrong?

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.920
It's too sweet.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.480
Then I-I'll get you...

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.560
It's okay. This way.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.120
I happen to like sweet things.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.800
Let's go.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.240
Where's the carriage?

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.760
Master Lu...

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.120
A'man.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.160
Why did Master Lu faint here?

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.720
- A'man.
- I'll take him back now.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.920
A'man.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.520
Lu Shi'an?

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.688
Master Lu, you should leave.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.800
A'man, I finally found you.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.600
Time to go.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.200
- Is Jin alright?
- Yes, yes.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.840
Did my blood help?

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.120
Your blood?

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.640
You should leave now.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.640
Stop!

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.200
Lady Ye.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.960
You've been feeding
the leeches these days?

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.520
Why didn't you tell me?

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.840
A'man,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.520
don't blame Lord Shen.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.000
Jin was already ill.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.440
He didn't want to distract you.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.960
Besides, the Lu residence
has been surrounded.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.440
It's inconvenient for me
to visit openly.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.800
So I let Lord Gao
escort me in each time,

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.168
and then escort me out,

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.880
regarding it an interrogation.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.160
Well...

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.040
Don't worry.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.080
I'm fine.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.440
As long as it saves Jin,

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.720
take as much blood as needed.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.880
This is what a husband
and father should do.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.040
Don't you agree, my lord?

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.000
You've said it all.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.080
What could Lord Shen say?

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.320
My lord, I have another request.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.560
May I see Jin again?

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.040
If your health can't bear it,

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.760
just return and rest.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.120
It's fine, A'man.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.240
I failed to protect you before.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.240
That's why all this happened.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.040
Don't worry about me.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.080
Thank you for saving Jin.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.680
She's my own daughter.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.560
Who else can save her but me?

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.320
He feeds only five leeches daily.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.040
That little blood

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.320
wouldn't make him this listless.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.800
Look at his feeble appearance.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.360
Who's he acting for?

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.160
My lord, if you can't bear this,

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.480
I'll storm in as the villain
and drive him away.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.360
A'man's distressed enough already.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.560
I won't add to her troubles.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.840
What?

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.480
I'm not blaming you.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.840
But you should learn from him.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.800
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.880
I don't like his theatrics.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.720
I'm here to massage Jin
and improve her circulation.

00:04:35.872 --> 00:04:37.320
This will help her recover faster.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.320
Thank you for your concern.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.320
Let me handle it.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.520
She's my foster daughter.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.240
This is my duty.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.520
Master Lu, you should return home early.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.360
- I'll handle this.
- No need. I can take care of it.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.920
Let me do it.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:53.040
Give it back.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.680
- I'll handle this.
- This belongs to me.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.840
I'll do it.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.080
My lord,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.720
the Lu residence remains sealed.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.320
And you handled the case yourself.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.760
I believe you don't need
to show partiality toward my daughter.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.520
Though this is your domain,

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.080
you should avoid impropriety.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.000
When upholding justice, what's to avoid?

00:05:36.128 --> 00:05:37.960
Dare you claim
to be completely impartial?

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.360
Master Lu, dare you say
your conscience is clear?

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.360
Jin needs rest.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.920
My lord, please escort Lu Shi'an back.

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.080
After you. Hurry.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.120
Go, go, go. Let's go.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.200
My lord.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.200
You still have matters to address?

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.240
I cannot give A'man status.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.400
But it doesn't mean
she's not part of Lu.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.520
How intriguing, Master Lu.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.280
No status.

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:19.680
No household registration.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.760
Except for being Jin's mother,

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.120
she belongs to no one.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.120
If I may venture to say,

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.520
I am Jin's biological father.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.800
That fact cannot be altered, can it?

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.680
Who says bearing someone's child
makes her his property?

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.320
The title of mother
was never meant to be shackles.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.640
Don't you care about her reputation?

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.720
I care more about her well-being.

00:06:52.896 --> 00:06:55.328
(Lu Residence)

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.160
Madam,

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.920
during these days of siege,

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.120
no fresh provisions could be delivered.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.040
These tea cakes are all that remain.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.760
Please make do with them.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:14.960
Got it.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:16.920
An,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.040
don't be afraid, okay?

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.200
I've found a solution.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.480
- Why is she making trouble again?
- An.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.520
- Didn't Shi'an watch over her?
- Where are you?

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.600
Master Shi'an keeps visiting
the clinic these days.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.240
He's too busy.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:28.880
An.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:30.440
Bring her in.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.280
An,

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.840
where are you?

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.200
Is it tasty?

00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.600
Yes.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.360
Eat slowly.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.520
What's wrong?

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.600
Why did you stop eating?

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.120
My An is going through a growth spurt.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:20.520
He gets hungry quickly.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.440
I'll take these back for him.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:25.960
No need.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.800
You eat this one.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
As for these,

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.760
you'll bring all these to Shi'an
when you leave.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.560
So many.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:38.640
So many.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.120
So many.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.080
Your hands...

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.320
Wipe your hands.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.640
Madam,

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.120
the guards keep blocking Master Shi'an
at the gate.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.120
They won't let him in.

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:01.720
He has been starving for days.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.760
Madam, no matter what,

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.480
you must deliver these tea cakes
to Master Shi'an personally.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:13.960
An...

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:20.520
An's hungry. So hungry.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.320
Since you enjoy grand gestures,

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.760
let the entire Ningzhou play your game.

00:09:32.448 --> 00:09:32.920
(Lu Residence)

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.240
An, I brought you snacks. Good boy.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.040
Stop!

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.720
You're the ones blocking my son

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.320
and keeping him from coming home?

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:46.560
Step aside.

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:48.720
Stand down!

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.120
No.

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:52.720
An is only six.

00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.560
He's starving.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.480
What if he gets kidnapped?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.360
Let me through.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.920
My son likes fishing at the riverbank.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:04.560
Go back.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.480
It's dangerous.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.080
They won't let you out.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:10.680
An.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.200
Don't harm An. I'm here to save you, An.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.480
I'm here to save you.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.160
Murder!

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:34.960
Murder!

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.360
Murder! Murder!
