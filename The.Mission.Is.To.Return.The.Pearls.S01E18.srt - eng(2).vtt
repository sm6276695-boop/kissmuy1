00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.680
You really are Li Zhong.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.480
How did you end up looking like this?

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:18.840
Jianjia definitely won't want you now.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:21.880
Young Master.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.240
Master Li.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.960
So,

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.200
Lord Li really doesn't blame Li Zhong anymore?

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.240
He's still one of my people.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.160
Besides,

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.200
this time Li Zhong

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.360
has made a great contribution.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.320
That's good.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.720
Alright.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.520
You all go back first.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.560
I still have something to do.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.320
I need to talk to Li Zhong.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.160
Okay.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.880
Let's go.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.800
So what's going on at Meiling now?

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.960
What's the situation?

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.280
We robbed people and goods.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.760
Then sent a few survivors

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.040
to pretend to be mad and escape back.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.600
The rest were all hidden away.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.360
Didn't kill them.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.600
But keeping them costs food.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.880
Sigh.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.120
I'm not going.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.680
I'm not going.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.440
What?

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.800
Do you still want to save Jianjia or not?

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.360
Ah.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.920
I do.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.960
If you do, then do as I say.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.720
The people at Meiling,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.760
how confident are you

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.600
in replacing them with our own?

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.680
Not confident.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.280
You...

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.720
But for Jianjia's sake,

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.440
I think I can.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.560
That's good.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.400
Hey, Young Master.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.640
What about Zhang Ji?

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.320
Zhang Ji...

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.040
I'll teach you.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.760
Li Ling let you come back.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.080
Yes.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.280
Did he say anything else?

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.000
He...

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.280
He said...

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.640
He said, "A servant cannot serve two masters."

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.760
A servant cannot serve two masters.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.440
So he acknowledges my status.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.240
Yes.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.920
That scared me.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.560
We mustn't let anyone see.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.000
How does Young Master guess so accurately?

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.920
Could that woman really be falling for Young Master?

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.840
Impossible.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.720
Absolutely impossible.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.760
Take it over there.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.000
Put it on top.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.200
Light the candle.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.160
Move it a bit, move it.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.800
Put it in the middle.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.920
That's right.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.720
Move it this way, this way.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.160
Move it to the back, the back, the back.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.560
Right now, the pearl oysters in Hepu waters

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.000
are less than a tenth of previous years.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.280
Thousands of pearl divers have lost their livelihoods.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.680
Lord Zhang,

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.800
as the governor of this region,

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.280
you still hold

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.000
this extravagant Pearl God Festival.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.920
I want to ask you,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.680
do you still respect the laws of the court?

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.080
Do you care about your people?

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.400
Lord Meng,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.800
I hold the Pearl God Festival

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.320
precisely for the people's livelihood.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.480
The Pearl God Festival

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.200
can gather the finest oysters from all over.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.840
We seek extraordinary pearls.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.120
Even if Hepu's oysters are gone,

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.560
Hepu's pearl industry

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.360
can still thrive.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.560
That's nonsense.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.880
You ignore the natural cycle.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.720
You force people to overharvest.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.880
That's why Hepu's oysters are dwindling.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.040
The pearl industry can't survive.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.600
Should those thousands of displaced pearl divers

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.800
be grateful to you, Lord Zhang?

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.840
Lord Meng,

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.640
a temporary hardship

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.400
for lasting prosperity.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.800
I believe

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.200
they will understand my intentions.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.200
Zhang He,

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.640
Lord Meng,

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.760
this is Hepu's internal affair.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.800
As Censor,

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.640
if you are dissatisfied with me,

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.440
you may report and impeach me.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.840
If His Majesty gives an order,

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.480
I will obey without question.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.280
Lord Meng,

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.280
you came here

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.760
just to reprimand me.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.480
Governor Li of Nan County

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.640
brought a cart of fine pearls

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.080
hoping to exchange them for grain.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.480
Ah,

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:29.800
Lord Meng,

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.560
Hepu's grain is also in short supply.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.760
Meiling is blocked now,

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.240
the grain route is cut off.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.080
Hepu's grain

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.120
barely feeds our people.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.160
Lord Meng,

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.160
tell me,

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.360
what should I use

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.720
to help the people of Nan County?

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.560
Lord Zhang,

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.560
Nan County is suffering a famine.

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.600
We should help them.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.920
Do you intend to stand by and do nothing?

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.160
Ah,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.120
Lord Meng,

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.920
I

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.240
wish to help but am powerless.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.680
Just as you expected,

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.080
everything was sent back.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.800
Ah,

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.200
It seems I was right.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.160
This Zhang He

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.160
has bigger ambitions.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:18.040
What do you mean?

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.320
You mean Zhang He

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.320
returned all the pearls he received,

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.240
pretending to care for the people,

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.880
refusing to sell grain.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.360
He exploits the people,

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.640
a corrupt official who ignores the pearl divers' lives.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.400
How could he be so kind?

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.120
You mean

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.560
he's after greater profit.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.280
I guess

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.280
when the people have no grain left,

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.720
only he will have grain.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:45.360
Then he can

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.600
extort great wealth from them.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.560
That jerk!

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.840
So next,

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:54.920
what do you plan to do?

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.080
Actually, what I wanted to do

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.000
Zhang He has already agreed to.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.640
Then I have a suggestion.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.240
Why not let everyone in the region

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.080
join the Pearl God Festival?

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.960
Let's hold a true southern

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.680
pearl feast.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.920
So you had me collect pearls

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.760
and deliver them to Meng Chang

00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.840
just for a spot in the Pearl God Assembly

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.080
Didn't he say

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:28.320
all counties

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.280
including maritime merchants

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.320
as long as they're willing

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.480
can send representatives

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.120
to join the Pearl God Festival?

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.840
But right now

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.880
Nan County's grain reserves are almost gone

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:41.040
What will the people do?

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.200
Either

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:44.120
we transfer grain from Meiling

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:45.120
or

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.440
wait for the maritime merchants to bring grain

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.640
What if neither comes?

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.520
Gather all the refugees

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:51.880
and head to Hepu

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.000
to force Zhang He

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.040
Even if Zhang He is unwilling

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.840
he'll have to provide some grain

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.200
either at a high price

00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.920
or to win people's favor

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.120
But at least this way

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.640
the people of Nan County won't starve

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:11.800
Father

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.760
I heard you agreed to Meng Chang's proposal

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.680
allowing people from all southern counties

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.160
to participate in the Pearl God Festival

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:18.800
His suggestion

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.000
can bring all the pearls of the land

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.240
together at the Pearl God Assembly

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.400
What's wrong with that?

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.840
But I think

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.560
Meng Chang has targeted you many times before

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.200
He's not that kind-hearted

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.720
You think I don't know?

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:35.520
Hmm

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.000
Meng Chang came here to investigate me

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.400
If he finds nothing

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.400
everyone is happy

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:42.680
If he does find something

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.520
Meng Chang's career will be over

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.440
Do you think the nobles in the capital will spare Meng Chang

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.200
or me?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.440
I accepted his proposal

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:57.000
to use his status as Censor

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.840
to boost the Pearl God Festival

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.320
No matter what Meng Chang intends

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.280
as long as I control the price of pearls

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.560
everything can change

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:11.160
What is it?

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:14.200
Are you afraid too many people will come

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.000
and you'll lose your place as Pearl God?

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.120
I've never dreamed of becoming Pearl God

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.120
My daughter

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.200
What I give you

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.000
is yours

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.840
No one can take it away

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.960
You failed last time

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.960
That was the chance I gave you

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.760
When you become Pearl God

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.400
your mother's memorial tablet

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.280
will be placed in our Zhang family shrine

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.880
I'll follow your arrangements

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.240
Sir

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.520
Sir, something's wrong!

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.320
Why are you panicking?

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:55.040
Many refugees have arrived at the city gate

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.640
They're all coming from Nan County

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.680
Let us in.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.280
Let us in.

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.920
Let us in.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.400
Sir.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:16.880
Sir.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.520
Governor, please save us.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.040
Quiet.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:22.560
Quiet.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.720
Quiet.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:25.560
You people

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.560
are not citizens of Hepu.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.880
Why should I save you?

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.280
If you know what's good for you, leave now.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.640
Otherwise,

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.960
don't blame me if my sword shows no mercy.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.080
You refuse to leave?

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:40.920
Kill them.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.440
Stop!

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.440
Spare us, sir! Please, sir!

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:43.880
Stop!

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.480
Lord Zhang.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.480
Do you intend to slaughter citizens of Han?

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.120
Lord Meng.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.480
Didn't I already say

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.280
that Hepu's grain is also in short supply?

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.680
There is no surplus at all

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.880
to give to outsiders.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:10:59.800
Lord Zhang.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.080
Even if Hepu's grain is scarce,

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.360
we must save lives first and find other solutions later.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.360
How can you just drive people away?

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.320
You, as the governor,

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.880
is this how you govern so diligently,

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:09.720
caring for the people?

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:10.920
Since

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.160
Lord Meng is so righteous,

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.400
then please

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.680
give us a solution.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.280
The grain I brought

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.880
except what is needed for the Imperial Guards,

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.960
the rest will be given out

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.720
to aid the victims.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:26.720
Alright.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.160
Open the granary.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.400
Distribute the grain.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.000
Set up porridge stalls.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.800
Thank you, Lord Meng.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.280
Thank you, Lord Meng.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.720
Thank you, sir.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.000
It's my grain.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.320
Thank you, Lord Zhang.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.000
A bunch of lowly people.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.840
Thank you, Lord Zhang.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.080
Thank you, Lord Zhang.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:41.800
Thank you, Lord Zhang.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.600
Everyone, please rise.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.360
Everyone, please rise.

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:45.760
Thank you, sir.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.920
Go and collect the grain.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:49.480
Thank you, sir.

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.280
Thank you, thank you.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.480
The bandits on Meiling Mountain

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.080
are your people, aren't they?

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.560
You think if someone goes missing from the prison,

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.560
I wouldn't know?

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.320
You think you didn't send your own men,

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.080
but sent the Meiling bandits instead,

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.880
and I wouldn't know about the attempt on Wang Lie?

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.440
I know I was wrong, Father.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.640
I admit my mistake.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.320
I'm not blaming you.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.440
I just wanted to see if the people you've raised

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.680
are actually useful.

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.040
I was just troubled

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.720
about how to make the rumor that pearls can't cross Meiling believable.

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.360
To create an opportunity for the Pearl God Festival.

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:36.120
Your little scheme

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.080
just happened to help me.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.160
Let me ask you,

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:42.760
today,

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.680
Meng Chang forced me

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.680
to distribute grain and shelter the refugees.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.480
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.200
A bad thing.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.720
If you think so,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.520
it means my plan

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.320
has worked.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.240
But isn't all that grain wasted?

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.080
Grain—

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.560
How much is grain worth in normal times?

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.840
Only life-saving grain during a disaster is truly valuable.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.000
I have plenty of grain.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
I don't care about that at all.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.480
What I want are those

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.000
starving refugees.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.480
Wherever there's grain,

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.800
there will be refugees.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.440
Inside Meiling, Hepu has grain.

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.000
But outside Meiling,

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.720
many counties also have grain.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.600
Some refugees will surely cross Meiling.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.480
When that happens,

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.240
the rumor that pearls can't cross Meiling

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.440
will collapse on its own.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.120
If there are survivors, the truth will come out.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.080
If there are no survivors,

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.720
nothing will change.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.000
If there are survivors,

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:54.680
but they can't speak,

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.040
still, nothing will change.
