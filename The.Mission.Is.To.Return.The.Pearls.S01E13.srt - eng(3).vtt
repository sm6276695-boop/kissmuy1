00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.160
Are you still alive?

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.760
Your grandpa here is tough as nails.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.120
I won't die that easily.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.720
Technically speaking,

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.280
you should call me Madam too.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.640
Young Master marrying you was just a temporary measure.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.480
It doesn't count.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.040
He held the wedding ceremony and entered the bridal chamber.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.600
How could Li Ling decide that?

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.240
Just because he says it doesn't count, doesn't make it so.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.000
You really have no shame.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.480
Young Master doesn't want you.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.840
You came here yourself.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.520
When did Miss Zhang become so cheap?

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.600
Jianjia.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.720
Jianjia, are you alright?

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.280
Jianjia.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.200
Jianjia, say something, Jianjia!

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.880
Jianjia.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.000
What did you do?

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.760
I'm begging you.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.880
Please let her go.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.600
Now you know to beg me?

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.560
What did you just call me?

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.520
I'm begging you.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.080
No, please.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.240
Madam.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.440
Madam.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.800
I'm begging you.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.280
Jianjia.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.400
Jianjia.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.160
Jianjia.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.440
If you want to save her, fine.

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.920
Help me with something.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.000
What do you want me to do?

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.760
This cut

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.400
is your punishment from earlier.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.960
Put it on.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.560
Go to Meiling.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.880
Become a bandit.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.160
I didn't expect

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.320
the Hepu sea shells

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.000
would actually migrate to Nan County.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.680
Back then, Wang Cheng wanted to beat me,

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.720
so he deliberately swapped Nan County's worthless shells for mine.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.680
Who knew the original Hepu shells

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.440
had already started migrating to Nan County.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.080
Impossible.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.240
Wang Cheng.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.520
You died so unjustly.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.440
Let go already.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.560
This...

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.200
What's going on?

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.880
Come with me, quick!

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.320
Slow down.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.600
Hurry!

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.200
So many!

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.280
Open it and see.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.200
Why all the secrecy?

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:06.520
This...

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.480
It's all jewelry here!

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.080
Yeah.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.720
Where did you get these?

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.160
The real wealth of the Jia and Li families

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.200
is all right here.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.680
Rong'er, you're amazing!

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.880
Come here, let me give you a kiss.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.760
I knew

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.120
if Zhang He made a move,

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.080
then both the Jia and Li families

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:34.680
would surely face disaster and confiscation.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.640
So after Kana found me,

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.160
I asked Kana to help.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.800
I had her send these

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.520
to the merchant ships ahead of time.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.040
Otherwise, do you really think I'd

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.680
do a losing deal so easily?

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.760
With these things on my ship,

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.320
they're collateral.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.800
If you two can't escape,

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.280
these things

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.480
will all be mine.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.280
Thank you, Kana.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.040
But speaking of which,

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:00.360
aren't you greedy for money?

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.400
You...

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.560
Why didn't you pocket some for yourself?

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:04.280
I'm an honest merchant.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.600
Not a thief.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.840
Can you spare some food?

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.400
I haven't eaten in days.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.360
Why are there so many refugees in Nan County?

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:32.720
Refugees.

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.680
The last famine.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.360
It came early.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.240
The bill, please.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.400
You can keep the change.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.840
Coming.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.120
Enjoy your meal, customer.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.160
Hey, wait, waiter.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:48.480
Here at your place,

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.880
do you pay the bill with pearls?

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:50.880
Of course.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.880
Now you can use pearls not just for meals,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.960
but also to buy grain, cloth, anything.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.280
Wait a second.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.080
We don't know why either.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.080
Tell me about it.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.400
Busy.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.120
Just tell me.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.520
Customer,

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.280
you're from out of town, right?

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:14.000
Yeah.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.440
Mm-hmm.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.360
People used to say,

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.280
Hepu pearls are the best under heaven.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.320
But now it's different.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.720
Now Nan County pearls are the best.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.280
You outsiders might not know this,

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.520
but our Nan County pearls

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.840
have surpassed Hepu.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:28.960
Really?

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.600
I haven't heard about that.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.760
Never heard of it.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:37.280
Come on.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.960
Go on.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.400
Nan County used to

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.560
not produce many pearls.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.160
But just a year ago,

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.120
lots of pearl oysters appeared by the sea.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.520
There were more pearls than we could harvest.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.720
After a while,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.240
some people got rich.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.120
Hey,

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.440
why didn't you go?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.280
Who says I didn't want to?

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:56.880
I...

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.080
That's the key.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.400
Stop messing around.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.160
Hurry up and tell me.

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.080
Be serious.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:13.880
Who wouldn't want to go?

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.400
But diving for pearls

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.720
is restricted by the authorities.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.160
All the good coastal land

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:20.720
is leased by the rich and powerful.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.880
Pearl farmers can still earn a bit by working at sea.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.240
But people like us with no skills

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.960
can only rely on

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.080
the crumbs that fall from the rich men's tables.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.560
I see.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.560
Thank you, waiter.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.240
Hey,

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.800
if we want to buy pearls,

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.880
where do we go?

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.920
There are government-licensed shops in town.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:39.600
Now all the pearls in Nan County

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.080
can only be traded there.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:41.800
Otherwise,

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:43.000
it's considered smuggling.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.640
That's punishable by death.

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:46.480
Hey,

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.080
Kana,

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:47.560
let's go!

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:47.920
Hey,

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:48.520
Wait,

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:49.800
no need to look.

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.800
Where are you going?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
You forgot your bag.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:52.560
Wait for me!

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:52.880
Hey!

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.400
You...

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:53.880
You...

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:57.840
Hurry up!

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.400
Kana!

00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.480
What are you doing?

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.720
You haven't taken your bag yet.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.080
I didn't expect Zhang He to issue a maritime arrest warrant directly.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.560
You can't show your faces anymore.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.280
Why aren't you included?

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:17.640
Why should I be included?

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.720
I didn't kill anyone.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.240
Neither of us killed anyone.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.920
Now pearls can't get past Meiling.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.160
If you want to sell Hepu pearls,

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.680
you have to go through us, the sea merchants.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.720
He wouldn't dare do anything to me.

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:33.520
Hey.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.200
I heard

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.760
you sea merchants

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.040
can you bring grain from Jiaozhi?

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:37.920
Transport grain over here?

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:38.480
Yeah.

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.240
Grain trading has always been

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.160
the main cargo for our ships.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.760
Hepu doesn't produce grain.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.320
The pearls you export

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.440
can be traded for a lot of grain over there.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.480
Back and forth,

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.360
the profits are huge.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.840
Oh.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.720
So after the grain arrives,

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.960
is it sold directly at the grain shops?

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.200
Yes.

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.920
Our Jia family's grain

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.760
is mostly bought from sea merchants.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.480
Now,

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.800
you only have one way out.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.520
That's to go overseas with me.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:13.080
Wait.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.160
I have another plan.

00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:17.320
But

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.240
you have to go to Jiaozhi.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:20.680
Okay.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.120
Aren't you going?

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.600
I have another way.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.280
What way?

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:29.880
Meiling.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.160
Not going.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.360
No,

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.720
You're so eager to send Rong'er to Jiaozhi,

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.240
but you came to Meiling—what are you up to?

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.280
I'm your employer.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.560
Why do you care so much?

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.080
I'm an honest merchant.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.080
Not a bandit.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.520
What if

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.600
I want you to be a bandit?

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.080
What kind of person do you think I am?

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:57.600
So now?

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.560
When do we set out?

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.680
We've waited so many days.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:04.920
Who exactly are you trying to rob?

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.040
You'll know soon.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.600
They're coming.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.920
You want me to rob an official?

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:18.080
And one escorted by Imperial Guards?

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:18.920
Are you crazy?

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.320
Yeah.

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:21.960
You—

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.080
Go.

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.040
Stop!

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:25.720
Nobody move!

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:26.840
Protect the lord!

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:27.720
Protect the lord!

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.680
Who are you scoundrels?

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.680
How dare you attack the Inspector Governor!

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.520
Corrupt official!

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.320
Prepare to die!

00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:44.560
Protect the lord!

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.760
What kind of corrupt official is this?

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.160
Why does everyone want to rob him?

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.560
Don't talk nonsense.

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:53.640
He's a good official.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.280
You rob good officials too?

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.480
Enough talking.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.760
So what now?

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.080
Surround them all.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:04.640
I—

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:05.640
Uh-huh.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.000
I only brought four people.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.000
Isn't this five?

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.760
Kawu is my brother.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:14.960
He's still a person.
