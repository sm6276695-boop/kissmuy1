00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.120
Li Zhong

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.480
This one.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.280
This one.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.880
And this one.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:31.720
Li Zhong

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.720
Li Zhong

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.440
Young Master

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.800
Let me help you.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.680
Swap the pearls.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.640
You really stop at nothing.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.120
Wang Cheng

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.760
Today I'll show you

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.520
that in the face of absolute strength,

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.080
all your tricks

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.120
are just a joke.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.840
Young Master Li

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.360
Have you chosen?

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.360
Then open it.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.000
Shopkeeper Wang

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.560
I suddenly want

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.720
to change the rules.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.280
What trick are you up to now?

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.640
I don't want to compare pearl size.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.560
Or value.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.920
I want to compare

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.160
the pearl yield rate.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.040
Li Ling

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.520
You're playing me.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.040
Pearl yield rate?

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.120
How do we compare that?

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.000
Compare the number of pearls from the chosen shell.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.680
Shopkeeper Wang

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.120
This bet

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.880
is happening in your shop.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.600
I'm already at a disadvantage.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.480
Can't I change the rules?

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.720
Unless

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.720
all the goods are yours.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.720
Shopkeeper Wang tampered with them.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.880
Change the rules.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.520
Shopkeeper Wang is afraid to lose.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.920
That's why he won't do it.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.080
Can you make him bet everything he owns?

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.760
Go all in against you?

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.160
It still depends on

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.040
your own skills.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.680
Where are his shells from?

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.960
Miss Shao switched his shells

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.800
for junk shells from Nan County.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.080
Alright.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.400
Li Ling

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.080
We'll do as you say.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.840
The shells in my shop

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.320
have a pearl yield rate

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.040
of over thirty percent.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.840
Oh dear.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.080
If you ask me,

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.160
your shop

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.080
is all false advertising.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.200
The goods don't match the description.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.200
Whether the pearl yield rate exceeds twenty percent

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.040
is questionable.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.720
But the shells I choose

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.560
if their pearl yield rate is below fifty percent,

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.920
I lose.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.680
Fifty percent?

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.240
Li Ling

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.880
Are you crazy?

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.480
If the shells you choose

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.120
have a pearl yield rate over twenty percent,

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.600
I lose too.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.000
If my shells' pearl yield rate is below thirty percent,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.160
I lose.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.240
Alright.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.840
It's a deal.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.720
Miss

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.480
If you don't stop the Young Master now,

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.400
it'll be too late.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:00.680
No.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.360
Don't stop him.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.800
Miss

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.560
Why?

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.080
Yeah, why?

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.080
Because I've never

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.520
seen him take anything so seriously.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.760
Open it.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.880
Li Ling

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.600
You're bound to lose.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.960
Shopkeeper Wang

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.000
Don't be so impatient.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.360
A cooked duck still resists.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.760
Alright.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:46.440
Continue.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.560
Two pearls were found.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.920
How is Shopkeeper Wang doing?

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.400
Young Master Li found so many.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.760
Young Master Li got so many pearls.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.040
Why are Shopkeeper Wang's all empty?

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.400
None at all, how come?

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.280
What's going on?

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:11.840
Why isn't there a single one?

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.840
Empty.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.280
This...

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.640
That's impossible.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.760
So many.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.280
So many pearls at once.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.080
They're plentiful and beautiful.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.600
Without makeup,

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.400
already a rare beauty.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.600
Precious pearls

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.920
should be matched with a fine lady.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.560
A perfect match.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.280
Later, I

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.440
will gather a full set for you.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.280
How about making a pearl necklace for you?

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.000
I don't believe it.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.440
The pearl yield rate is this low?

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.440
The pearl content percentage is really less than twenty percent.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.720
Such a low pearl yield rate.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.600
This Wang's Pearl Shop really is a shady place.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.120
Young Master Li is truly impressive.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.280
No need to open the rest.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.320
The pearl yield rate has already exceeded fifty percent.

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.320
Shopkeeper Wang.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.880
You lost.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.360
Alright.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.680
Li Ling.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.320
You two

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.240
colluded to frame me.

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.840
Miss.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.440
I've brought everything you asked for.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.960
These handkerchiefs

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.880
were all embroidered by me.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.800
I thought

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:52.520
Shopkeeper Wang truly cared for me.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.400
He would never treat me as merchandise again.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.400
Feigned affection.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.720
False sincerity.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.160
Let it all burn away.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.320
So many love letters

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.640
were all from Shopkeeper Wang.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.120
He once told me

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.360
every frown and smile

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.800
captivated his heart.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.240
Impossible to forget.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.840
I never expected

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.520
it was all fake too.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:21.560
Burn them.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.720
Burning them is right.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:31.600
Shopkeeper Wang's affection

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.600
now

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.160
is all over.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.600
The past

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.080
is nothing but smoke.

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.720
Wretched maid.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.920
Nonsense!

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.200
I never wrote them.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.320
He really didn't write these.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.400
I receive so many love letters every day.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.920
How would I know who wrote them?

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.880
What a convenient lack of evidence.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.320
What a cuckold's hat.

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.480
As you wish.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.880
Young Master kills with words.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.080
I wound the heart.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.480
To apologize for the pearl exchange just now.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.320
That's not right.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.480
What if I had lost just now?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.120
Then the name embroidered on this handkerchief

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.960
would be Li Lang.

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.480
Impressive.

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.000
Reading the script while riding a donkey.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.760
Alright.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:26.680
Then...

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.880
I'll give Miss Shao a gift too.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.880
Shopkeeper Wang.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.560
Then this indenture contract

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.440
should belong to me now, right?

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:50.480
Alright.

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.120
Miss.

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.600
Young Master is being reckless again.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.320
From now on,

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.320
I belong to Young Master.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.200
Ah!

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.280
It's burned.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.120
That's the indenture contract of huakui Shao Wanru.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.560
Just burned like that.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.720
Miss Shao.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.320
You're free now.

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:14.720
Alright.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.400
The Prefect has arrived.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.880
Master Zhang.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.760
Master Zhang

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.200
Save me

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.400
Master Zhang

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.440
No

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.120
Master Zhang

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.000
No

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.240
I did all this for you, Master Zhang

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.240
Master Zhang

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.080
Master Zhang

00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:52.840
His life

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:54.600
now belongs to me

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:57.240
Young Master Li

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.600
The Wang Pearl Shop's ten years of business reputation

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.440
has been ruined by you in a single day

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.800
You really want to take the money

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:06.720
and even take a life?

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.720
Since the Prefect has spoken

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.120
Shopkeeper Wang's life

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.720
I can let it go

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.000
But this Wang Pearl Shop

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.520
has official documents as proof

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.480
Sir

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.800
Surely you won't make things difficult for me?

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.760
This Wang Pearl Shop

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.600
is the official shop for government and maritime merchants

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:27.880
Oh

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.840
May I ask

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:31.400
which government office

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.960
and which official?

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:34.640
The Prefect's Office

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.000
I am the official

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.680
Then

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.480
According to the Prefect's words

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.000
this black-and-white contract

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.320
doesn't count anymore?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.800
It counts

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.600
Of course it counts

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.720
Once the government

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.280
and the Wang Pearl Shop finish the inventory

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.680
what Wang Cheng owes you

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.200
I will guarantee

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.640
will be repaid in full

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.280
Then

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.280
I thank you in advance, Sir

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.680
Farewell

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.800
Let's go

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:24.560
We'll go too

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.080
Miss Shao

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.080
Today

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.880
I helped you burn your indenture contract

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.400
I also dealt with those people for you

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.040
Especially Wang Cheng

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.480
When he knelt down

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.600
it was truly satisfying

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.960
What do you mean?

00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.600
Young Master

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.200
Why ask when you already know?

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.440
Without this document

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.560
people

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.680
won't see you

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.080
as my protector

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:09.960
Wait a moment

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:10.760
Miss Shao

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.400
You say the world is vast

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.680
You can go anywhere

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.360
You can even join a respectable household

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.320
Why do you cling to me?

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:27.760
I

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.320
was originally a fisher girl

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.400
My mother

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.840
was beaten to death by my drunken father

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.920
My brother went to sea with my father to collect shells

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.280
but entered deep waters by mistake

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.520
and was caught in a storm

00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.240
never to return

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.200
I was left alone and helpless

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.440
tricked by relatives

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.680
and sold into a brothel

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.320
A drunken father

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.280
a mother who died young

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.480
a brother who died prematurely

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.240
a broken family

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:10.160
But what does this have to do with me?

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.040
Goodbye

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.000
Young Master

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:16.600
How do you know

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.920
that our meeting in this life

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.040
isn't to make up for past regrets?

00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.080
Maybe

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:28.480
our meeting in this life

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.520
was something we begged for

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:32.680
in our previous lives

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:34.800
Previous lives

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:35.400
Hmm

00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.680
Our past lives weren't as you say

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.040
What are you doing?

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.280
Get out of my way

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.680
How dare you block my lady's path

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.160
No

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.480
You can't go in

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:54.640
Oh no.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:55.680
Don't make such a fuss.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.360
No, you can't.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:56.920
Miss, hurry and leave!

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.200
You can't go in.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.120
Miss!

00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:00.320
You can't go in.

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.560
All of you, leave first.

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.200
All of you, leave first.

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.560
You too, get out.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.360
I'll go out too.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.800
Be careful yourself.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:52.680
What?

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.760
Hurry, hurry!

00:14:59.080 --> 00:14:59.600
No, no, no!

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.200
Don't!

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:02.760
Get up, quickly!

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:03.840
Let go!

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:04.600
No, that's not it.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.080
Oh dear.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.440
Rong'er!

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.680
Let me explain!

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:10.720
Rong'er!

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.800
I... I...
