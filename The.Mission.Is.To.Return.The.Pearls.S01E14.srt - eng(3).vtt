00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.320
Wake him up.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.600
Your Excellency.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.320
You brazen thief!

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.200
How dare you attack an imperial official!

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.040
Oh.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.480
Imperial official?

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.640
People like you who commit evil deeds,

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.120
corrupt officials who abuse the law,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.200
still have the nerve to call yourselves imperial officials?

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.200
What a joke.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.560
A scholar prefers death to humiliation.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.480
Since I took office,

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.120
I have worked diligently to remove old injustices for the people.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.800
I have overturned wrongful cases for the oppressed.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.800
When have I ever committed corruption or abused the law?

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.880
You corrupt officials

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.160
always speak so grandly,

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.160
but in reality,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.920
you're full of thieves and crooks.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.800
What?

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.040
You say I am a thief and a crook?

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.320
Fine.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.560
Then tell me exactly what I've done.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.360
What crimes have I committed?

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.560
What have I done to deserve heaven's wrath and people's hatred?

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.760
Ah.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.800
If you're not a corrupt official,

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.680
then why did you come to Hepu

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.320
to clean up Zhang He's mess?

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.720
Zhang He in Hepu

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.960
has roped in officials at every level,

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.440
they're all in cahoots,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.640
colluding with the wealthy,

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.520
and exploiting the people.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.360
Thousands of pearl farmers in Hepu

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.080
have no food or clothing.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.560
You never care about the people in daily life,

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.120
but as soon as something happens with the tribute pearls,

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.920
you all show up.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.560
And you still claim you're not corrupt officials?

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.880
Who says I'm here to clean up Zhang He's mess?

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.320
I'm here to uncover the truth about the tribute pearls.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.240
Oh.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.520
Isn't that cleaning up the mess?

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.160
You little thief.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.760
I can't reason with you.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.120
If you want to kill me,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.320
just do it.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.840
Are you sure you robbed the right person?

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.040
I heard Meng Chang is a good official.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.520
He's exactly who I robbed.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.720
No.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.800
Do you really want to get us both killed?

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.480
Hey.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.600
We're about to fight Zhang He.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.320
What do we need most?

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.000
Wait, wait.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.640
Stop trying to solve everything with violence.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.440
What we lack now is backing.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.760
We need someone powerful above us.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.480
But are you sure he'll help us?

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.360
If he doesn't help,

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.360
then we'll eliminate him.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.880
Your Excellency.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.120
We...

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.680
May I speak with you privately?

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.800
Untie me.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.360
We're in the middle of nowhere.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.240
Conditions are limited.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.480
Please forgive us.

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.000
Lord Meng.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.080
You know me?

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.160
And who are you?

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.080
Southern Hepu.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.120
The Li family.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.840
Li Ling.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.560
The largest pearl merchant in Hepu.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.640
Li's Pearl Company.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.400
Li's Pearl Company

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.600
no longer exists.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.280
Ah, so

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.040
you're here to seek justice from me?

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.040
May I ask, Your Excellency,

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.440
what brings you to Hepu?

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.480
I am acting under the Emperor's orders.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.760
To oversee Hepu.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.600
Investigate why pearls can't pass Mei Ridge.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:18.760
Oh.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.920
Your Excellency,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.000
I dare not speak the truth.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.440
With the imperial decree here,

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.640
how could I speak carelessly?

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.120
This decree

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.360
is just for outsiders to see.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.040
But the Emperor's spoken command

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.160
must mean more than this, right?

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.920
What do you mean by that, Mr. Li?

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:35.480
Hepu South Sea pearls

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.760
are the finest in the world.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.560
They sell well across the country and overseas.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.520
Among all this,

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.480
the annual profit

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.960
exceeds millions of coins.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.280
Even though the court sets a sixty percent tax,

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.400
what actually reaches the capital

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.640
is only a little over a hundred thousand coins.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.800
In all this,

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.280
local officials,

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.320
court officials,

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.640
local noble families,

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.720
aristocratic clans,

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.000
all of them are profiting handsomely.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.400
As for the details,

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:57.280
I suppose

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.960
there's no need to explain them to you.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.480
I am curious,

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.320
how do you know all this?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.160
It's all deeply intertwined.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.000
Everything is connected.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.280
Where did you get

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.680
the prefecture office's

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.840
documents from Prefect Zhang He

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.920
written by his own hand?

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.680
How did they end up with you?

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.040
It's a long story.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.200
I risked my life for them.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.800
It seems Hepu

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.560
is far more complicated than I thought.

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.640
After Your Excellency arrived in Hepu,

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.800
I suppose

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.160
everything will look prosperous again.

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.720
Maybe soon,

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.640
these pearls

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.800
will be able to pass Mei Ridge.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.720
But the people's suffering

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.000
and the corruption in the bureaucracy

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.480
will not change at all.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:59.400
Moreover,

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.360
the most pressing issue now

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.760
is that Hepu

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.360
is about to run out of pearls.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.520
Why is that?

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.760
How could there be no pearls?

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.520
Eating next year's food,

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.480
overfishing,

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.000
caused the shellfish to migrate.

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.240
Now there are no shellfish to harvest.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.920
No pearls to collect.

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.880
Why does the government commit

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.360
such short-sighted acts?

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.880
Every year, the government

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.120
sets taxes and quotas.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.440
Pearl households are given fixed quotas.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.920
If they fail to meet them,

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.280
their grain is withheld.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.840
And whether the shellfish are good or not

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.120
is decided by the officials.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:31.600
Without grain,

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.520
the pearl households must fish more to get food.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.880
And each year,

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.000
the quotas keep increasing.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.440
They have no choice but to keep fishing.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.080
Taxes are collected in grain.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.640
People can only buy food from government-approved shops.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.800
And the grain price is set by the government.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.400
This cycle repeats.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.240
How can the people live in peace?

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.960
Li Ling.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.360
Were you joking about what you just said?

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:57.560
Your Excellency,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.720
You may verify it as you wish.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.960
Very well.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.440
I understand.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.840
Li Ling,

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.480
You will return to Hepu with me.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.120
Your Excellency,

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.680
Zhang He has issued a wanted notice for me.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:14.000
I am charged with a capital crime—murder.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:15.800
Ah.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:17.480
So you still want

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.080
me to help you clear your name.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.400
Your Excellency,

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.280
I am also in Hepu,

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.920
one of the many people hoping for your help.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.480
Then,

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.880
how should I find you?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.720
In Nan County.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.120
I suppose your men

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.200
will wake up soon.

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:35.880
I

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:36.920
will take my leave now.

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:48.400
Hey!

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.240
Don't move.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.440
What's your name?

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:51.480
Hmph.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.080
Hey.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.000
None of them woke up.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.160
Only you did.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.880
Are you interested in coming overseas with me?

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:57.360
No.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.200
Hey.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.560
Refusing a toast, but accepting punishment instead, huh?

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.080
Kawu,

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.520
Don't slack off. Go.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.560
Hey, hey, hey!

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.320
I may be handsome,

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:06.960
and have depth,

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.360
but I will never submit to you.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:07.640
Kana,

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.160
Stop messing around.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:08.520
Let's go.

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:09.240
Oh.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.000
Young master!

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:12.800
Is that you?

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.440
Young master!

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.400
I...

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.040
Young master!

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.000
Li Zhong!

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:22.920
Young master!

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.200
You have no idea what I've been through.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.960
Darn it!

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.560
That bastard Zhang Ji!

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.040
She scratched my face,

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.480
and stuffed me into a vat.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.080
Do you know that?

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.000
It was so wide,

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.080
such a huge vat!

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.640
She shoved me in just like that.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.200
I was like a turtle,

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.320
stuck in that vat for ten days!

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:41.960
Oh man...

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.200
You two grown men,

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.320
why are you crying?

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.720
This is Mei Ridge.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.760
If you keep crying, you'll attract wolves.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.280
Zhong,

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.920
I asked you to spread

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.440
the rumor that pearls can't pass Mei Ridge.

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.840
I didn't expect it would get you into trouble.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.000
Young master,

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:00.120
I want to follow you.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.000
But Jianjia...

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.760
Jianjia is still in Zhang Ji's hands.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.480
I can't just leave her.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.400
So...

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.560
I can't go with you yet.

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.400
Get up and sit down first.

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:21.840
You're right.

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.000
Jianjia is in Zhang Ji's hands now.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.760
She planted you as a bandit in Mei Ridge.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:27.320
If you disappear,

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.680
something will definitely happen to Jianjia.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:30.360
But on the other hand,

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.840
as long as you stay in Mei Ridge as a bandit,

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.840
Jianjia still has a chance.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:35.880
The matter at Mei Ridge

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.320
isn't over.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.160
Young master,

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.920
I don't fully understand,

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.240
but I get it.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:44.960
As long as I stay in Mei Ridge,

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.400
and gain Zhang Ji's trust,

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.320
I'll have a chance to help you in the future.

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:50.880
Right?

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.480
It's getting late.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.240
I should go.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.720
They'll wake up soon.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.080
I can't let them know you were here.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.160
Wait.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:02.800
I just don't get it.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.760
Why does Zhang Ji want you in Mei Ridge

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.600
to ambush and kill Lord Meng?

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.040
Zhang Ji said

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.160
even if the pearls are confirmed to have passed Mei Ridge,

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.240
it can only bring temporary peace.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.640
The court will definitely send someone to investigate.

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.280
As long as they investigate,

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.760
they'll find some clues.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.000
So,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.560
let the officials sent from above

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:19.760
all die in Mei Ridge.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.160
Then blame it on the Sea God.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.840
That way, there will be no witnesses.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.240
Is Zhang Ji an idiot?

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.600
If she kills one,

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.920
the court will just send another.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.320
She can't kill everyone, can she?

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.400
She doesn't have to.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.040
Every time an official dies, a new one is sent.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.080
It always takes some time.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.040
With all this back and forth,

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:39.720
it's enough time for them

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.920
to come up with a perfect plan.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.400
Why are you looking at me?

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:46.600
Young master,

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.200
she said

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.400
you taught her this.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.280
I...

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:53.960
I should go back.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.800
I...

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.240
Li Zhong,

00:10:59.400 --> 00:10:59.920
take care.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:03.760
Got it.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.600
Young master.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.080
Hey, are you really not coming to sea with me?

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.680
I didn't expect that.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:11.200
You're not that great,

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.000
so why are your men

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.200
so loyal to you?

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.280
Mind your own business.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.480
After I go back this time,

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:20.080
I'm heading out to sea.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.160
Go ahead.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:23.240
Oh, right.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.640
If you go to sea,

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.800
bring back some grain for me.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.680
What do you need grain for?

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:30.120
This time, in the Southern Commandery,

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.280
there might be a famine.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.680
The grain you bring back

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.280
could save a lot of people.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.280
How do you know there will be a famine?

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.200
Just do as I say.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:40.640
Why ask so many questions?

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.400
Who's paying for it?

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.120
Isn't all my money on your ship?

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:48.480
How about this:

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.640
if your prediction comes true,

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:51.800
I'll pay for the grain.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.520
I'll cover it.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.480
You said it.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:55.920
Yeah.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:56.640
It's a deal.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.480
I'm off.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.360
Stay safe.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.240
Okay.

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.520
Hurry, hurry!

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.920
Move quickly!

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.560
Welcome, Your Excellency Meng.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.640
Your Excellency Meng has arrived.

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.800
I apologize for not greeting you sooner.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:36.680
Prefect Zhang.

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:37.960
No need for formalities.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.160
My lord.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.800
You must be tired from your journey.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.800
Please come inside so we can talk.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.680
Prefect Zhang.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.600
Before I enter the office,

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.120
I want to show you something first.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.120
Bring it here.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:10.600
Your Excellency Meng.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.800
What does this mean?

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.360
Prefect Zhang.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.000
I led my men here from Mei Ridge.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.600
We found pearl merchants dead on the official road.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.480
Is this what you reported to the court

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.080
as "no pearls leaving Mei Ridge"?

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.360
Is this what you call

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.640
"the Sea God's punishment"?

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.360
Prefect Zhang.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.400
It seems clear to me that under your rule,

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.720
bandits run rampant,

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.120
killing and robbing travelers.

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.320
Your Excellency Meng.

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:39.520
On your way here,

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.440
did you encounter any bandits?

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.080
Or are you saying

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.440
these merchants died because of the Sea God's wrath?

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.240
Ah,

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.240
thank you for clearing that up, Your Excellency Meng.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.760
I don't believe in such superstitions either.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:56.080
I'm currently organizing the Pearl God Festival in Hepu.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.600
I've also ordered the pearl households

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.000
to speed up the harvesting of sea shells.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:13:59.800
After all,

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.200
the tribute is due soon.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.280
I

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.440
will not fail His Majesty,

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.200
nor you, my lord.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.200
Prefect Zhang.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.160
It seems you and your colleagues in Hepu

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.000
are truly united in your efforts.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.040
Oh,

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.920
you flatter me, my lord.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.960
I want to review the past five years'

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.320
case files from Hepu.

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.720
Is there any problem with that?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:26.920
Of course not.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.360
They are ready for you, Your Excellency Meng.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.440
Your Excellency Meng.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.360
Please.

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.040
My lord.

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.000
Why do I feel

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.400
these people mean trouble?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:41.680
General Wang.

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.120
We are the ones who just arrived.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:46.480
Prefect.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.000
Shouldn't we

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.600
send a letter to the capital

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.440
to inquire about the situation?

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.440
Are you telling me how to do my job?

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.200
I wouldn't dare.

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:58.520
Wait.

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.880
Bring me all the case files on the Li Ling case.
