=Episode 15=

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.920
Madam.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.200
Jin.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.120
Madam.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.640
Come on.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.720
No outsider here.
You can call her Mother.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.040
Mother.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.160
I thought

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.200
getting Jin back
would require great effort.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.760
It's the Governor-General's request.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.160
Who would dare refuse?

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.920
Mother.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.360
Father.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.760
Let's stay together forever.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.640
Never part. Okay?

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.600
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.440
Let's go.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.240
Did you send someone to kidnap A'man
and implicate my family?

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.080
If I wanted her dead,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.280
I'd fight her to the death

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.640
when our son passed.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.160
Why bother kidnapping her?

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.920
Jinzhi,

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.240
I... I...

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.520
I spoke in panic.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.720
I didn't doubt you.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.480
Enough with the pretense

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.240
and acting.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.120
Jinzhi.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.920
The Lu family faces crisis.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.480
We must overcome this together.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.000
I can't even send word to my father.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I can't help you.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.240
Oh, right.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.520
Your concubine
is in Lord Shen's chambers.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.560
Go beg her

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.840
to spare the Lu family.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.160
Xia Jinzhi.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.280
We are husband and wife.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.200
Must we torment each other?

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.680
When did you ever treat me as your wife?

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.640
Then when did you ever see me

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.240
as your husband after we got married?

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.120
My lady,

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.320
the Master forbids
offerings for Lady Qin.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.360
Perhaps we should go back.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.000
You may go back now.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.720
I want to stay here alone.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.400
If they find it,

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.520
just tell them I escaped myself.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.080
Today's your birthday.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.160
Perhaps the Master has prepared gifts.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.320
Let's go back now.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.280
Since my mother's passing,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.240
who would ever remember my birthday?

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.000
Let me speak with her awhile.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:10.360
(Mother,)

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.960
(are all concubine's daughters
destined to suffer?)

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.360
(I really miss you.)

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.120
Lady.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.200
Your departed loved ones

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.960
might not want to see you so soon.

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.720
None of your concern.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.320
Water ghosts might dwell
beneath these waters.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.360
Take this.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.000
It'll ward off ghosts if you jump.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.400
(Mother,)

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.000
(after you left,)

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.400
(this is my first birthday gift.)

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.360
Father.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.600
Father.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.680
Father, I beg you.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.160
I don't want to marry Lu Shi'an.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.560
My heart belongs to another.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.720
If I can't find him,

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.640
I'll remain unwed.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.440
Nonsense!

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.200
You've always resented
your concubine-born status.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.640
So

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.600
I arranged your marriage with a merchant
as his proper wife.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.800
If you bear a legitimate heir,

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.080
you'll become the matriarch.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.960
Do you understand?

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.040
If you insist on defying me,
you'll remain a concubine's daughter.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.920
From now on,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.120
you're no daughter of mine.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.000
- Father!
- Hmph!

A'man.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.680
Jin.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.160
A'man.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.640
Come on.

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.840
What's wrong?

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.840
Do you hear someone calling me outside?

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.760
No.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.720
It's too hot.
It must be the cicadas singing.

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.440
Right, Jin?

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:03.200
No entry!

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.160
I'll just take a look. I won't go in.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.520
Step back.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.560
Jin, come have some watermelon.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.440
Okay.

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.080
Let's have this piece.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Jin, don't eat too much.
Or you'll get a stomachache tonight.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.600
You're so contradictory.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.160
You ask her to eat when it's hot,
and worry she'll get cold.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.600
Are you afraid of heat or cold?

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.920
I'm disciplining my kid.
Stop interrupting.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.840
Watch your tongue.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.480
Understand, Jin?

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.280
Good girl.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:40.440
She's too harsh.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.320
Go. Bring a piece to Mr. Gao,

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:43.920
okay?

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.720
Okay.

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.080
Take it slow.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.560
You should also have a piece.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.680
You enjoy opposing me.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.400
Alright.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.560
Just have a piece.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.480
Let's go. I'll show you something.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.600
Let's go.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.960
What are you doing?

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:15.360
Jin asked me yesterday

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.440
about Xiangshan Hermit's poem:

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.256
I know it rained at night outside,
for the plantain leaves spoke first.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.840
She asked what it really means.

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.480
I tried explaining,
but couldn't make it clear.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.160
And it hasn't rained lately.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.360
So as her foster father,

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.040
I must create
a rain-on-plantain-leaves scene myself

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.280
for her to listen.

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.120
At Jin's age,

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.120
she's full of "whys".

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.880
No one in the Lu family
explained things to her before.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.560
But you've shown patience,

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.240
going to great lengths to teach her.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:52.240
There are some things

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.280
you won't truly believe

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.080
or understand

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.760
until you've lived through

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.480
or experienced yourself.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.320
What do you think, Lady Ye?

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:08.320
Shen Que.

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.480
I know what you want to say.

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.280
But right now,

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.520
I can't.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.280
You don't have to answer
what I haven't asked.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.520
Plantain leaves may whisper first,

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.640
but rain must fall first.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.240
Wait.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.520
I'll bring rain

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:35.720
for you and the entire Ningzhou.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:13.680
Wake up and eat.

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.120
The sun's baking your bottom.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.280
Little lazybones.

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.560
Get up.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.400
Jin?

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:27.720
Jin?

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.000
Jin!

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:29.880
Jin!

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:48.240
How is she?

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.120
Gao Fu?

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.040
It seems like poisoning.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.120
Seems like poisoning?

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.080
This is beyond my expertise.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.120
I can't identify the poison now.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:04.680
A'man,

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.400
did Jin eat anything unusual lately?

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.160
I asked her to only eat what I give her

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.640
and never take food from others.

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.160
She wouldn't disobey.

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.560
If it's a food-borne poison,

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.040
this antidote will work.

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.880
If not...

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.400
What then?

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.480
The physicians have all left.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.680
I wonder if Jin's awake.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.120
A'man.

00:11:59.240 --> 00:11:59.960
Stay calm.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:00.760
Have some water.

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.160
How is it? Is she awake?

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.000
Jin hasn't woken.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.840
Based on multiple diagnoses,

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:06.920
Jin was poisoned.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.160
Could it be

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.480
that someone tried to harm her?

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.480
Who'd be so cruel?

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.840
She's just a child.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:19.560
Gao Fu,

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.040
is there a way to detoxify her?

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.280
I've used antidote pills.

00:12:22.496 --> 00:12:24.096
The physicians also prepared potions.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.440
Please rest assured.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.200
Jin is safe for now.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:28.800
No.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.320
I must check on her.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.080
She won't return.

00:12:38.976 --> 00:12:40.128
Finish what you were saying.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:41.080
I'm sorry, my lord.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.360
This poison is too vile.

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.880
I truly can't identify its origin.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.000
Moreover, it has
a long incubation period.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.744
It doesn't seem
to be administered recently.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.040
The necrotic bruises on Jin's skin
are caused by blood stasis.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.160
Besides,

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:53.240
the cruelty

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:54.680
of this poison

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.480
lies in gradually congesting
all blood flow,

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:57.360
until...

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.160
Is there still hope?

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.560
My master once mentioned

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.320
in sinister detox methods,

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.080
leeches engorged with fresh blood
can be medicinal.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.760
Okay. I'll go find some now.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.000
- I'll go with you.
- No need.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.880
You stay here and watch over them.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.720
- Don't tell her yet.
- Understood.

It's enough.

What are you doing?

00:14:31.328 --> 00:14:33.184
Didn't you say it needs fresh blood?

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.560
It must be blood from immediate family.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.920
In other words, Master Lu's blood.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.280
Then take this to Lu Shi'an immediately.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.000
