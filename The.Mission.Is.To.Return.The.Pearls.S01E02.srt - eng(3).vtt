00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.200
Li Ling

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.640
Three

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.680
Two

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.800
One

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.320
Why did you leave again?

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.760
Li Ling

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.560
You went gambling again.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.200
I will never marry a hopeless gambler like you.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.560
Li Ling

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.840
You’ve really let me down.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.440
Rong’er

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.760
I won’t lose this time.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.640
Trust me.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.440
Li Ling

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.560
We’re not finished yet.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.320
Are we gambling or not?

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.920
Shopkeeper Wang

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.760
Let’s begin.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.360
Damn.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.960
I’m not ready for this right now.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.880
Young Master Li

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.520
If you’ve chosen, reveal it.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.760
Don’t rush.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.200
Oh, right.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.600
I still remember.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.120
Which shells Wang Cheng picked that had pearls.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.600
What’s he trying to do?

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.440
Li Ling

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.480
What are you up to now?

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.520
These are my shells.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.880
Shopkeeper Wang

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.120
I just think

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.520
the shells on my side

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.720
are all worthless.

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.480
I want to pick a few I like from your side.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.320
Shopkeeper Wang, are you not willing?

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.880
Or is it

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.080
that the shells on my side

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.320
have all been tampered with by you?

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.280
Ridiculous.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.560
Then

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.240
This one, this one, this one.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.080
I don’t want it.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.560
I want it.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.400
This one.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.880
Since

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.840
Since Young Master Li thinks this batch is suspicious,

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.000
let’s switch to another batch.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.480
To keep things fair.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.680
How am I supposed to play now?

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.080
We didn’t switch shells last time.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.360
How am I supposed to guess?

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.200
Young Master Li

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.240
Go ahead.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.440
Wait.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.880
What trick are you trying now?

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.320
If I remember correctly,

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.400
in the last two rounds,

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.600
I already beat Shopkeeper Wang

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.560
for two hundred thousand coins.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.760
And this round,

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.680
Shopkeeper Wang is betting his life.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.760
I’m betting everything I own.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.720
But those two hundred thousand coins

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.840
haven’t been settled yet, right?

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.120
Cash

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.120
Two hundred thousand

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.760
Then I'll add another hundred thousand coins

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.920
Li Ling

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.120
You're shameless

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.320
Why are you so aggressive, Young Master Li?

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.240
Relying on your family's status

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.040
Are you just bullying us ordinary folks?

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.320
Wow

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.320
Isn't that Hepu's top beauty

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.040
Shao Wanru?

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.760
Didn't expect Shopkeeper Wang to pursue her for years

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.280
And finally win her over

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.760
Since she's Wang Cheng's longtime beloved

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.680
Shopkeeper Wang doesn't need money then

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.000
We can bet on something else

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.280
For example

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.120
Hepu's top beauty

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.880
Shao Wanru's indenture

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.880
How about it?

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.080
This wastrel is ruthless

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.080
Shopkeeper Wang spent a fortune back then

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.040
Just to get Shao Wanru's indenture

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.640
Wang Cheng definitely won't agree

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.640
She's the apple of his eye

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.360
Fine

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.880
The indenture is here

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.520
And she's here too

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.680
If you win

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.520
She'll be yours

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.240
Wait, hold on

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.600
That's Shao Wanru

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.800
You worked so hard to get her indenture

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.120
You'd just give her away?

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:39.960
Have you really thought this through?

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.880
Enough nonsense

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.000
Are you betting or not?

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.600
Miss, did you see that?

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.080
This kind of person

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.520
He's not worth your trust

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.160
Gambling with the one you love

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.000
That's inhuman

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.080
Shopkeeper Wang

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.680
I'm not like you

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.520
Someone like him

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.840
Isn't worthy to gamble with me

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.600
Li Ling

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.040
What trick are you playing?

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.640
We had an agreement

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.240
I'm not in the mood today

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.160
See the guests out

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.280
What kind of person is that?

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.000
Exactly

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.120
Says he's done and just quits

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.040
Everyone got scared and ran off

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.440
Why are you still here?

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.520
She doesn't even care about you

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.600
Finally sent them away

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.320
I need to find a way

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.840
To get my special skill back

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:51.840
No, no

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.000
I'm not tricking you

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.040
Wang Cheng

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.160
Shopkeeper Wang, don't

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.320
In my previous life

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.560
I lost everything I owned

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.480
Wang Cheng broke both my arms

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.960
Only then did I gain my special skill

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:08.880
Could it be

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.680
Wait a minute

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.520
This could work

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.360
Young Master

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.400
Young Master

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:28.880
What are you going to do?

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.080
I won't let you hurt yourself like this

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.760
Li Zhong

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.240
Oh, Young Master

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:38.120
How much did you lose this time?

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.840
How could I possibly lose?

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:44.120
I'm your young master, after all.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.280
Yes, yes, that's right.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.520
Young master never loses.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.520
Young master always wins.

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.160
Bah, nonsense!

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.200
Good, you're here.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:49.840
Do me a favor.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.200
Come on, hand it to me.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:51.440
Come.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:51.840
Take this.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:54.480
Break it.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.160
Hey!

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.600
I can't believe you'd say that.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.640
You want me to break it?

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.160
Yeah.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:07:59.560
Young master.

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:02.200
This was left by the master and madam before they passed.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:03.480
No.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.080
Today, Miss Jia Rong'er

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.840
is very angry for some reason.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.680
She said if she sees you again,

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.600
she'll break your hand.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.960
And then break my legs.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:12.800
What did you say?

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:14.360
That's right.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.440
Why would she want to break my legs?

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:17.800
Let's go.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.800
Young master, why are you walking so fast? Where are you going?

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.320
It's pouring outside.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.080
How dare you!

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.080
Do you know who I am?

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:27.640
Move aside.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.240
I know.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.440
Young Master Li.

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.200
Future son-in-law.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:35.320
If you know, why are you still pushing me?

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.480
I need to see your young lady.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.360
Sorry, Young Master Li.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.680
Miss said,

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.600
Young Master Li and dogs

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.760
are not allowed inside.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.520
Please don't make things difficult for us.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.720
Rong'er!

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:47.480
Didn't you say you'd break my hand if you saw me?

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.440
I'm right here.

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.120
Come out!

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.320
Why have people blocking me?

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.120
Come out!

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:51.240
What was that noise outside just now?

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.400
I know you can hear me.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.920
Young Master Li is here.

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.960
He insists on seeing you.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.240
The gatekeepers stopped him.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.160
Miss.

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.240
If you ask me, you shouldn't bother with him.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.640
He's either out partying every day

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:03.320
or getting fooled like an idiot.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.200
No matter how big the Li family business is,

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.680
he'll squander it all sooner or later.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.320
When uncle and aunt were alive,

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.640
they treated me very well.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.000
And I'm engaged to him.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.360
So I can't just ignore him.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.600
He's not a bad person by nature.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.240
He only changed after uncle and aunt passed away.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.760
That's when his personality changed.

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.120
I don't know

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.960
when he'll finally turn over a new leaf.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.200
Rong'er, come out!

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.440
I really need to talk to you.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.960
Come out, please!
Make him quiet down.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.240
Alright.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.240
Rong'er!

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:32.280
Didn't you say you'd break my hand if you saw me?

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.160
I'm right here.

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:33.680
Come out!

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.840
Young master, stop shouting.

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:35.560
It's embarrassing.

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.600
Let's go.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.160
Don't pull me.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.040
Rong'er! Rong'er!

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:44.880
Stand steady.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.600
Get up, get up, get up.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.640
Young master.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:52.800
Young master.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:53.920
Let's not do anything foolish.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.360
Miss Rong'er will definitely marry you.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.720
Don't do anything stupid.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.400
What if...

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.240
What are you saying?

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.120
I'm serious.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.960
If it's serious, use the main gate.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:02.920
The main gate?

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.320
Can I even get through?

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.240
Oh.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.680
Young master, good luck!

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.040
Reeds and rushes

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.080
What was that sound?

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.880
Maybe it was a stray cat.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.080
It's done.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.280
Useless.

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.480
What use are you to me?

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.840
Lost two hundred thousand coins.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.920
And you let that Li Ling escape.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.560
Sir,

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.600
You saw it yourself.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.760
The bait has already been set.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.880
Li Ling took the bait.

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:26.800
But he didn't get hooked.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.840
So your plan must be flawed.

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.240
Why did we set up this scheme?

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.520
It's all for the Li family's money.

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:34.920
With the Li family's money,

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:36.600
we can cover this year's deficit.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.760
With the Li family's money,

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:40.040
the appetites of those aristocrats in the capital

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:40.840
can finally be satisfied.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.000
Not to mention,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.920
the Li family's trade route

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.440
could earn us a fortune.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.120
Ah.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.720
Now,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.240
now we've lost everything.

00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:51.480
Everything is gone.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.520
Maybe that Li Ling

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.440
is already suspicious of us.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.680
You useless fool.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:56.760
Tell me,

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:58.680
what use do I have for you?

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:00.720
Sir,

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.920
give me one more chance.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.800
I can definitely do it.

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.960
No problem.

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.480
Fine.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.040
I'll give you one more chance.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.600
Listen carefully.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.840
I want the Li family.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.960
If you can't get it,

00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.960
I'll take your head instead.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.160
Understand?

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.480
Yes, yes, I understand.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.120
Get out.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:24.840
I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.440
Useless.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.000
Useless.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.880
Why won't Miss let us in?

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.440
How would I know?

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.920
I just teased you a little.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.120
Why are you so upset?

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.680
When uncle and aunt passed away,

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:13.560
they asked me to take good care of you.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.720
Why are you acting out again?

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.960
Since we were kids,

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.880
we grew up together.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.800
I know you're not bad at heart.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.720
But these years,

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:35.680
you've been reckless and refused to change.

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.600
It's not that I'm bullying you.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.000
It's those people outside flattering you.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
They're all after your family's wealth.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.640
I discipline the servants

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.280
for your own good.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.200
A-Ling,

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.560
when will you

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.880
understand my good intentions?

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.760
This

00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.520
was handed to me by aunt herself.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.640
Together with your blue bead,

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.000
they're a matching pair.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.120
They're also a token between us.

00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.560
I hope aunt, watching from above,

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.640
can bless you with safety.
