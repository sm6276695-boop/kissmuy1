00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.560
Mei Ridge

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.840
The trade route from Hepu must pass through Mei Ridge.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.120
In the previous life, Zhang He hid tribute pearls for himself.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.920
He spread Sea God rumors to keep pearls from leaving Mei Ridge.

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.640
So this time,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.240
if I take the initiative first,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.600
Ah,

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.240
tell me,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.200
we're just married,

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.960
the wedding night isn't even over,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.560
are you really leaving?

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.280
Isn't that exactly what you want?

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.920
How can you say that?

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.320
Lately I've heard,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.680
Hepu has no shells to export,

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.480
so the people, forced by hardship,

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.240
have turned into roaming bandits.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.720
They wander between

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.240
Mei Ridge and Hepu.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.320
And Mei Ridge

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.320
just happens to be the only way for Hepu's trade.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.320
Are you worried about me?

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.800
You're my wife.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.000
Caring for you

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.760
and helping you

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.880
is my duty as your husband.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.040
If that's how you see it,

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.160
you already have a plan.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.160
I just want to ask you,

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.040
do you want to go?

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.000
If not for my father's orders,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.560
I wouldn't want to travel so far.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.760
Risking my life.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.480
But if I don't go,

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.600
I'll be whipped every day in this house.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.680
Ah,

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.440
I do have an idea.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.880
Oh?

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.280
These refugees have become bandits

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.240
only recently.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.440
They're not a real threat yet.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.080
But if one day

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.440
these bandits grow more rampant,

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.520
blocking Hepu's trade route,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.560
Mei Ridge,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.280
then you'd have a reason not to go.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.640
But these refugees run around every day,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.400
they might not stay in Mei Ridge.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.200
That's true.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.760
With your influence,

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.840
raising bandits shouldn't be hard.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.520
Then when the time comes,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.520
how should I deal with my father's crackdown?

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:51.880
Ah, my dear,

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.680
tell me,

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.720
if the bandit problem isn't real,

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.240
but the Sea God is angry and brings divine punishment,

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.920
forbidding pearls from leaving Mei Ridge,

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.880
do you think your father

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.680
would truly act for the people,

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.000
sending troops to suppress bandits,

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.880
or would he

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.160
go along with it,

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.120
using the Sea God's name

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.040
to keep the pearls in Mei Ridge?

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.200
A rare commodity is worth keeping.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.720
Greetings, Father-in-law.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.200
Li Ling.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.960
You arrived just in time.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.800
You, as a father-in-law, are abusing your power.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.640
You want to buy a whole cart of my finest tribute pearls for just a hundred thousand coins?

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.000
These pearls—

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.760
If I resell them overseas,

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.680
I could make at least another hundred thousand coins.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.880
My good son-in-law,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.120
Come, tell us—

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.320
What price did you originally set

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.680
when you sold them to Miss Kana?

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.840
Father-in-law,

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.840
Eighty thousand coins.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.000
See?

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.120
Miss Kana,

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.800
You resold them

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.720
and made a profit of twenty thousand coins.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.960
Plus, you saved yourself

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.600
the trouble of traveling around.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.960
Li Ling,

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.000
those pearls back then—

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.240
why did you sell them to me at such a low price?

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.960
Don’t you know the reason yourself?

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.680
And the task I gave you,

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.320
didn’t you fail to handle it properly?

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.080
I haven’t even deducted your payment yet.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.160
Birds of a feather.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.960
I’m not selling anymore.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.880
I’ll ship them overseas myself.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.080
I can sell them for double the price.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.760
Miss Kana,

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.720
without an official pass from the governor’s office,

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.200
your ship

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.160
can’t leave Hepu.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.400
Is that so?

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:36.880
This batch of pearls

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.720
is indeed worth two hundred thousand coins.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.120
But the price I sold them to you for

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.280
was truly low.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.960
If you ship them overseas to sell,

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.440
there will be plenty of costs along the way.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.600
How about this—

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.520
Let me make a suggestion.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.720
Let’s compromise.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.200
One hundred twenty-eight thousand coins.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.400
This way, everyone

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.200
can prosper all year round.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.200
Father-in-law,

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.560
what do you think?

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.200
Since my son-in-law has spoken,

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.080
how could I refuse?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.720
So, Miss Kana, what do you say?

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.200
You—

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.600
You’re all working together,

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.360
all of you are villains.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:18.960
Bring the contract.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.120
Miss Kana.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.280
Once you bring the pearls over,

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.120
I will have everything ready.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.040
Alright.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.520
Okay.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.520
Once the contract is signed,

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.240
give me the travel permit immediately.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.760
This lousy place of yours,

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.480
I don't want to stay here a moment longer.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.440
Kana, let's go.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.480
Father-in-law.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.000
Hmm.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.960
Why buy so many pearls?

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.800
Ah, this is all thanks to you.

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.960
We're about to pay tribute soon.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.160
The tribute pearls from the prefecture

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.440
are completely gone.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.240
I wanted to use your family's pearls

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.160
as tribute to send to the capital.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.120
But you,

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.680
sold them all to the sea merchants.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.480
Tell me,

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.200
if I don't buy them back from them,

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.120
do you have a better solution?

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.120
This matter

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.600
isn't entirely my fault.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.280
After all, I'm just a pearl seller.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.480
But

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.080
buying pearls from the sea merchants

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.680
is only a temporary fix.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.760
Do you think I haven't considered that?

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.880
I've already ordered

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.040
the pearl households

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.560
to hurry and harvest more oysters.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.000
Try to make up for this year's shortage.

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:35.800
But now,

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:35.840
the pearl yield in Hepu has dropped sharply.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.920
The pearl yield in Hepu has dropped sharply.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.960
If we increase harvesting now,

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.120
we'll only be draining the pond to catch the fish.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.560
Ah.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.680
My good son-in-law,

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.120
you're still too young.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.520
There are many ways

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.200
to maximize profit from pearls.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:55.840
To

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:58.440
motivate the pearl households,

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.080
I'm planning to hold a Pearl God Festival.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.960
Just wait,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.520
you'll be the Pearl God.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:15.160
Pearl God, Pearl God, Pearl God.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.840
If the tribute pearls issue is exposed,

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.880
you, as the Pearl God,

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.120
will be the perfect scapegoat.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.000
Pearl God.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.520
The Pearl God Festival is happening earlier than expected.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.280
My plan has to move up too.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.400
Xiao Hong.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.680
It's getting cold.

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.200
Go get me a coat.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.000
Yes.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:45.880
Rong'er

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.960
Your handwriting is really ugly.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.520
Practice more.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.440
What does this mean?

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:59.320
It means I've checked it.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.080
Our flower umbrellas are really good quality.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.600
Miss, buy one, please.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.280
Sure.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.640
Alright, alright.

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.000
Miss

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.880
Have you heard of the Sea God?

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.800
Are you crazy?

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.640
Have you heard about it?

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.440
Get lost.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.080
Hey.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:44.360
Did you hear?

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.680
Mei Ridge is haunted.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.360
You're nuts.

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.000
Do you know?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.120
Mei Ridge is haunted.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.120
You look more like a ghost.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.240
It's true, it's haunted.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:54.920
Do you know?

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.200
Mei Ridge is haunted.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.520
There's a Sea God.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:58.480
Really.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:03.520
His tongue is super long.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.320
He even carries a hammer.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:05.880
Bang bang bang.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.320
That Sea God eats people and pearls.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:08.680
Quick, tell everyone.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.200
Hurry, hurry!

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.280
You haven't seen it.

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.760
It has big wings on its chest.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:12.760
It's taller than a person.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.760
It's terrifying.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.400
Let me tell you a story, kids.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:25.680
What story?

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.360
What kind of story?

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.560
Well, it's like this—

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.840
The Sea God is here!

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.160
We need the official to help us figure something out.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:06.960
Right?

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.440
Sir,

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:12.240
Sir, the pearls can't cross Mei Ridge.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:32.960
All the money is right here.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.600
Miss Kana,

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.640
Let's settle payment and goods.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:46.800
Come, take it away.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:49.520
Hey!

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.000
I'm selling pearls,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:51.960
not the boxes.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.240
Bring your own boxes to pack them.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:54.520
You—

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.000
What do you mean?

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.040
Do you know how much

00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:00.080
your Lord Zhang made me lose on this deal?

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.920
These two boxes are made of nanmu wood.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:03.600
They're expensive!

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.240
Fine, whatever.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:08.320
Go.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.160
Bring two boxes.

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.360
What do you want me to do?

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.120
Help me sell this batch of pearls

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.840
to the prefecture at a low price.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.360
Then spread the word

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.000
that they were all bought from me.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.240
The prefecture is selling pearls.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.160
Why would they buy pearls from me?

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.680
From now on,

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.280
Hepu will have no pearls.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.520
The prefecture will have no pearls.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.240
Only you will have pearls.

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.720
The end of the year is near.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.720
Hepu must offer tribute pearls to the court.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.640
Lord Zhang will have to buy from you.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.280
What will it cost me?

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.200
Help me take a few people away.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.280
May you have a long and happy marriage.

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.040
Your plan is to marry Zhang He's concubine's daughter.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.800
If I don't join their scheme,

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.600
I'm as good as dead.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.320
What do you know?

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:07.640
Oh.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:08.960
You mean

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.560
you want to find their weakness.

00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.480
At least make sure everyone survives.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.320
You're still here,

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.760
so you haven't taken them away.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.600
You've broken your promise.

00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:17.080
Fine.

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.360
I broke the deal first.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.320
Go ahead.

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.280
What do you want me to do this time?

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.080
Still want me to take people away?

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.080
Who?

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.160
Me.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.280
Hey, wait!

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.160
And Jia Rong'er.

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.240
When?

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.520
Let's set a code word.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.360
The selling price of the pearls

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:31.240
will be the final date.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.800
I have a suggestion.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.200
Let's compromise.

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.440
128,000 coins.

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:37.560
Bring the contract.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.520
Xiao Hong,

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:54.960
I'm sorry.
