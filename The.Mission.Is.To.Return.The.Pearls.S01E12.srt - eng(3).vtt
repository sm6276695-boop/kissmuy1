00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.000
What should we do now?

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.560
Wait.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.920
Come here.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.520
Sir!

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.240
Please stand up for us, sir!

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.680
The Sea God is angry!

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.560
Pearls cannot pass Mei Ridge!

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.640
Looks like the advisor has things to do.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:59.440
Go ahead.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.120
Excuse me.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.600
No one's here.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.200
Let's go.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:13.560
Hurry.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.960
Wait.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.680
What are you doing?

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.640
Rong'er, what are you doing?

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.160
There's no time, Rong'er.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.320
What are you doing?

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.000
Ah!

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.560
Sir.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.520
Sir.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.800
Something's wrong!

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.960
Oh my goodness!

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.280
Why are you here?

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.480
Madam!

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:42.920
They're all waiting for me outside.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.360
Kana has arranged everything.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.680
The people and carriages are all outside.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.840
If you don't hurry out,

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.960
we'll run out of time.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.000
What do you think we should do?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.280
What if Zhang He comes back?

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.360
I found the list.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.600
What list?

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.080
Zhang He is so arrogant

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.960
because someone powerful in the capital

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.440
is supporting him.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.280
I think the people on this list

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.080
are connected to those forces behind him.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.160
This should be useful.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.640
What do you mean "should"?

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.720
This is very useful!

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.360
Rong'er, you're amazing!

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.560
Kana can't wait any longer.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.240
Let's go!

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:08.720
I can't wait either.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.360
Let's go!

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.000
Next time, next time.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.840
Coming!

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.400
Come in!

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.680
What's this about pearls not passing Mei Ridge?

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.480
What's going on?

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.680
Recently, Hepu pearls have had low yields.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.640
Rumor has it the Sea God is angry.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.880
He no longer blesses Hepu.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.200
Now pearl households are crowding the entrance.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.400
They say if pearls can't pass Mei Ridge,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.160
they won't collect shells anymore.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.200
They also say those pearls

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.800
can't pass Mei Ridge.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.680
Looks like Prefect Zhang has things to do.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.400
Go ahead.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.720
Recently, merchant caravans heading to Mei Ridge

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.720
as long as they carry pearls,

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.040
either die or go mad.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.600
Those pearls turn to dust.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.120
Ridiculous!

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.400
Where do these superstitions come from?

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.960
Oh!

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.800
Sir!

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.160
Pearls cannot pass Mei Ridge!

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.440
Please stand up for us, sir!

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.920
Quiet!

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.400
Everyone, quiet!

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.720
What's this about pearls not passing Mei Ridge?

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.120
It's all nonsense.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.200
Pearls cannot pass Mei Ridge!

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.520
Sir.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.440
Enough!

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.440
If you keep causing trouble, you'll all be arrested.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.280
Where's the son-in-law?

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.760
With his personality,

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:17.920
such a lively scene,

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.040
he wouldn't miss it.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:20.760
Where is he?

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.200
Uh...

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.960
I don't think we've seen the son-in-law from the start.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.480
Darn it.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.400
Giddy up!

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.000
Sir, we've checked everything.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.160
Only when Miss Kana delivers the pearls

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.280
could they possibly escape.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.880
You useless fool.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.400
What use are you to me?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.240
Take your men and chase them now!

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.320
Yes.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.360
Go!

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.680
Go!

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.280
This is outrageous!

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.840
Whoa.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.520
Ouch.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.880
Miss, something's wrong!

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.080
What happened?

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.040
The son-in-law escaped with Madam Jia.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.360
Which way did they go?

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.640
The sea merchants took them away.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.880
They headed toward the docks.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.440
I'll go after them.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.240
Go back and tell Father.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.960
Something's happened at Mei Ridge.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.920
Alright.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:53.680
Sir.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:55.920
The Sea God has arrived.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.880
The pearls are gone.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:05.240
Li Ling.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.960
You liar!

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.640
Even if I have to chase you to the ends of the earth,

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.280
I won't let you go.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.520
Hey.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.800
This one looks better than the last.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.360
My craftsmanship is pretty good, right?

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.600
It's beautiful.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.720
Where are we going?

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:36.600
To the ends of the earth.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.160
Shall we go?

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:38.840
Let's go.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:48.760
Tell me,

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.240
There are bandits at Mei Ridge,

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.560
and the trade route is blocked.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.680
Yes.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.920
Your daughter is weak and alone.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.840
That's why she had to flee back.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.560
So the tale that pearls cannot pass Mei Ridge,

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.520
who started that rumor?

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.920
When I returned,

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.520
I caught a few people and questioned them.

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.360
The rumor came from a man and a woman.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.280
I guess it must be

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.480
Li Ling and Jia Rong'er’s former servants.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.360
Well, well.

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.880
Li Ling ran away.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.360
And you came back in disgrace.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.360
So, apart from the Li family's assets,

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.400
after all our effort,

00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:29.720
we got nothing.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:35.920
It's bad enough Li Ling escaped,

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.560
he even took the list linking Hepu and the capital.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.000
If that list is exposed,

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.680
your brother's days in the capital

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.280
will be miserable.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.800
Zhang Ji.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.000
You haven't really fallen for that boy, have you?

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.400
No, Father.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:02.720
Oh dear.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.640
Li Ling is really clever.

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.000
Don't think you're the only one with tricks.

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.160
Pearls cannot pass Mei Ridge.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.200
Fine.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.560
Then I,

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.480
will truly make sure pearls cannot pass Mei Ridge.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:16.920
Zhang Ji,

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.640
your good husband has abandoned you.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.760
The Deity of Pearls position that belonged to him

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.440
will now be yours.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.760
Issue the prefect’s order:

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.480
Li Ling murdered Wang Cheng.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.880
He fled to avoid punishment.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.720
Jia Rong'er aided the bandits.

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.840
She will be punished as an accomplice.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.040
Issue a wanted notice.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.040
Arrest and bring them back.

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.320
Seize all assets of the Jia and Li families.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.280
Confiscate everything.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.600
After such a serious injury,

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.960
his power seems to have grown even stronger.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.120
The wind is strong tonight.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.400
Put this on quickly.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.960
Your wound hasn't healed yet.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.920
Don't catch a cold.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.240
Stop thinking about fighting Zhang He.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:02.360
The people can't win against officials.

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.480
Even as a Han, you don't understand this as well as I do.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:06.760
You don't get it.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.800
But what if I say

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.920
we can still fight back?

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.320
If we want to deal with Prefect Zhang,

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.880
what's the most important thing?

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.720
Pearls, of course.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.200
That's right.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.520
Pearls cannot pass Mei Ridge.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.440
The trade routes in Hepu are blocked.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.680
My Li family

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.200
still has trade routes in the Central Plains.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.280
Now, Hepu's pearl production has dropped sharply.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:40.520
He took over both the Li and Jia family businesses.

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.840
And your last chest of pearls

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.040
only solved an urgent problem.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.600
Hepu became a prefecture

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.320
because its southern pearls are the best in the world.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.880
If Hepu has no pearls,

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:53.800
how long can he stay as prefect?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:54.800
How long can he hold his position?

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.720
If Zhang He has no pearls,

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.640
and neither do you,

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:00.160
That's right.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.200
We don't have any pearls now.

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.080
Zhang He holds all the power.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.760
We still have no chance of winning.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:27.480
This...

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:29.920
Is this true?

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:32.640
Li Ling,

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.240
I'm not dreaming, am I?

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.120
What are you two looking at?

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.760
Every beam of light you see

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.800
comes from a pearl-bearing oyster.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:15.680
Li Ling,

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.600
have you noticed

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.840
these oysters

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.000
are all moving in the same direction?

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.240
Oyster migration.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.920
Oyster migration.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:35.760
Kana,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:36.920
let's follow them and see.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.120
Alright.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.640
Kawu,

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:42.520
Yeah?

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.360
Full left rudder.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:44.480
Got it.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.200
Are you still alive?

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.040
Your grandpa is tough.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.920
I won't die.
