00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.440
Grain

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.320
Where did Li Wenshun get the grain?

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.040
Yes

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.200
It was given by the maritime merchants.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.200
Maritime merchants?

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.240
How did Li Wenshun get involved with the maritime merchants?

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.120
It seems

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.800
The foreigner from the Lingyun Pearl was the go-between.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.280
That little witch again.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.880
Now she's linking Li Wenshun with the maritime merchants.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.120
With just one word from Li Wenshun,

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.280
those commoners were pardoned for their looting.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.720
This infuriates me!

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.400
Go

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.640
Write a letter.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.800
I want to ask Zhang He myself.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.440
Lord Zhang of Hepu.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.000
He's always had dealings with the maritime merchants.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.680
That woman

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.520
is also from Hepu.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.080
I suspect he's behind this.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.240
But we're allies with Lord Zhang.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.600
Allies?

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.360
Hmph.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.000
Hepu is short on pearls now.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.640
But they've had their eyes on our Nan Commandery pearls.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.880
Using tribute pearls

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.920
to trade for a governor's life.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.760
Taking advantage while I have no pearls.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.320
When the tribute pearls are in crisis.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.080
That Wang Lie

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.440
is trying to take advantage of our misfortune.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.400
Father

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.800
But the Pearl God Festival is approaching.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.360
Is it necessary for us to deal with them now?

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.360
He's trying to threaten me.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.760
The aristocratic families in the capital

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.160
never respect the governors.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.800
Including me.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.120
Besides,

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:59.680
your brother's life

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.880
is still in their hands.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.480
Send someone over.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.040
If it can't be done,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.240
Yes

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.880
My lord

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.000
Zhang He received a letter from Nan Commandery.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.960
Do you know the contents?

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.680
No

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.320
My lord

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.680
Do these files contain solid evidence?

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.480
They were sent by Zhang He.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.080
How could he leave any flaws?

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.480
But these files basically prove

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.040
what Li Ling told me

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.520
was not a lie.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.720
But as for the migration of the sea shells,

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.800
I sent frogmen

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.800
to investigate the coastal villages personally.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.040
So far,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.520
Li Ling's words are true.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.000
If everything he said is true,

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.400
then the grain disaster in Nan Commandery

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.840
is a real catastrophe.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.320
Did Lord Zhang send you?

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.480
Yes

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.440
Alright

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.680
Go tonight and get Li Wenshun

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.520
and kill him for me.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:08.760
Young Master

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.720
Li Zhong

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:12.880
These bandits

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.480
are far too brazen.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.440
They even dared to break into the Governor's residence.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.320
Intending to harm me.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.320
Oh dear

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.400
Lord Li

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.160
Why do you say "break in"?

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.040
Didn't you say anyone can enter the Governor's residence

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.200
as long as they pay?

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.560
Even the night clothes are worn openly.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:28.360
Oh dear

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.000
I owe you my life again.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.080
But right now,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.880
I truly have no one to rely on.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.600
Sigh

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.840
How can you say that?

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.760
Isn't someone right here for you?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.280
Didn't this person come to you himself?

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:40.400
Young Master

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.760
He calls you Young Master.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.320
Why is that?

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.520
Oh dear

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.480
It's a long story.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.040
I'll explain it to you later.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.160
Let's first figure out

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.720
what exactly happened this time.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.120
Wang Lie

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.160
ordered the Governor of Hepu

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.720
to hire assassins.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.560
This is unbelievable.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.840
Unbelievable.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:06.760
My life, Li Wenshun's life,

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.600
is so easily dismissed by them?

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.360
At that time,

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.840
did you really plan to kill Lord Li?

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.680
How could I dare?

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.640
I just sent my men to do it.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:19.800
Besides,

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.880
I'm smart enough

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.120
to see it was just a pillow.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.200
Anyway, Zhang Ji said

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.280
if we failed,

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.720
just blame it all on Wang Lie.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.720
No one said we had to kill Lord Li for sure.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.880
So Zhang He

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.360
isn't afraid of being exposed

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.600
and getting implicated?

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.000
Lord Li

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.960
People like Li Zhong,

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.640
alive, their words mean nothing.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:41.600
Dead, and dead men tell no tales.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.160
Young Master

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.160
Why do I feel

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.680
so miserable when you say that?

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.080
When can I return?

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:48.520
What,

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.000
don't you want your Jianjia anymore?

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.520
Lord Li

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.400
These merchants

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.120
hiring assassins to kill a Governor

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.120
is a capital crime.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.200
Whether this is

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.280
true

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:01.200
or false,

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.160
no matter how powerful the aristocratic families behind it are,

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.080
Lord Li

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.760
shouldn't you take action?

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.280
Well...

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.320
Lord Li

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.120
This grain

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.280
can't get past Meiling.

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.440
And news

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.240
can't leave Nan Commandery either.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:20.720
Hmm

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:34.240
It's done.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.400
Hmm

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.680
Master

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.440
The Governor's residence is in chaos now.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.640
Seems something big happened.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.840
Li Wenshun

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.040
You dared to offend me.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.480
This is your fate.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:03.320
You may leave.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.440
One more thing.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.800
I wonder if you

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.520
are interested.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:11.240
Speak.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.760
Near the eastern suburbs, not far from the Governor's residence,

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.960
we found a granary.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:16.880
It stores

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.320
a large amount of grain.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:20.520
Really?

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:23.080
You run a grain business.

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.120
This kind of news

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.480
should fetch a good price.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.000
Wait.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.280
The rules of the underworld.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.880
The information sold to you

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.560
must not be passed to a third party.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.000
Yes.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.280
Someone, come!

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.800
Guards!

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:34.880
Don't move.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.880
Let me go!

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.080
How dare you betray me!

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.440
I'll kill you all!

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:45.200
Young Master.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.040
I've done something great this time, right?

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:50.880
Li Wenshun.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.720
Do you really dare to touch me?

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.840
You're about to die,

00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.720
and you still act so arrogant.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:02.520
And who are you?

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:03.200
Oh?

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.200
You forgot about me, sir.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.440
Oh, right.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:09.160
Hmm.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.280
Oh.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.480
So that little witch sent you.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.720
If you say so,

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:16.680
that's fine.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:17.640
But,

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.520
I'm afraid you won't leave here alive today.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.400
If you dare touch me,

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.480
can you handle the consequences?

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.800
Wang Lie.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.440
I'll kill you!

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:40.800
What's wrong?

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.320
Ah!

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.000
That jerk!

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.760
He sent people to sink the ships.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.640
All three of my big ships sank.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.080
All the grain is gone too.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.480
So many people haven't eaten yet.

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.720
What?

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.160
The ships sank?

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.240
The grain is gone?

00:10:59.120 --> 00:10:59.840
Li Ling.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.040
You owe me ships.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:01.960
You owe me grain.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.240
Did you think

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.640
I didn't have a backup plan?

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.400
and still dared to come here?

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.360
I've prepared a big surprise for you.

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.640
Report!

00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.120
Report!

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:27.880
The Nan River levee broke!

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.920
Floods for miles around!

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:29.920
This year's crops

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.080
are all ruined.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.640
You're insane!

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.200
You're insane!

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:40.400
Wang Lie.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.560
For your own selfish desires,

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.480
you ignore the lives of the people.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.320
Your crimes are unforgivable.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.040
Li Wenshun.

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:54.640
You're just my dog, Li Wenshun.

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.640
Do you dare kill me?

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.440
Do you dare kill me?

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.160
Wang Lie.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.520
Darn it, Wang Lie!

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.840
This grain disaster

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:29.960
has come after all.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.320
We were unloading cargo at the time.

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.440
Only half the grain made it ashore.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.400
The rest sank with the ship.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.280
Even if I urgently transfer grain from Jiaozhi now,

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.600
and bring it here quickly,

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.160
the round trip will take time.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.000
The people of Nan Commandery can't wait that long.

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.400
The pearls from Lingyunzhu

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.200
could have been traded for a lot of grain.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
But now,

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.080
there's no grain to exchange.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.080
The breach and the shipwreck

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.440
can't be kept secret.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.200
The grain disaster

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.280
will surely cause panic among the people.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.200
If we have no good solution,

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.800
all of Nan Commandery

00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:07.800
will suffer greatly.

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.360
Nan Commandery has pearls but no grain.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.400
Where are pearls most needed?

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.560
Are you referring to

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:21.880
Hepu?

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.400
How much grain is sold to Hepu

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.600
by the maritime merchants?

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.080
No one knows better than I do.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:33.920
Even counting the reserves from when trade routes were open,

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.520
to sustain

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.640
both Nan Commandery and Hepu,

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.480
the livelihoods of the people in both regions,

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:40.960
won't last long.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.440
Can it last until

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.880
you bring grain from overseas?

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:49.360
Sigh.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.520
Maybe if we sail at full speed.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.240
But you forgot my ship sank.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.360
I'll send an official vessel

00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.920
to take Miss Kana out to sea.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:02.920
Alright.

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.400
Then I'll set out now.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:11.920
Wait for my return.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.280
Young Master,

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.320
did you notice

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.640
that this time Kana

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.200
didn't mention money to you?

00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:29.800
Talking about money

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.360
hurts relationships.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:36.760
Lord Li,

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:38.480
there's one more thing

00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.520
I need your help with.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:40.760
Please, go ahead.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.880
We need to gather all the pearls

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.360
and take them to Hepu to exchange for grain.

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.480
But this time,

00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:46.480
the pearls

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.040
can't be handed to Zhang He.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.440
Then who can we give them to?

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.800
The Imperial Inspector,

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:53.800
Meng Chang.
