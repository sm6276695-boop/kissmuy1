00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.200
Lingyun Pearl Shop

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.520
Rong'er

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.960
Take care of everything.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.280
If things can't be done,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.520
just come back right away.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.360
Okay.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.360
When you return from Meiling,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.080
if you need to go to Nanjun,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.960
go to this place.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.240
Take care.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.840
I forgot about this.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:47.800
Oh no.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.360
Get lost.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.240
Move aside.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.520
Get out of my way.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.680
Everyone move aside.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.800
Move aside.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.240
Move aside.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.280
Move aside.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.920
Hyah!

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:16.760
Move aside.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.920
Move aside.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.600
Are you blind?

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.600
Can't you see?

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.600
Bad luck.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.760
Outsider.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.640
Don't meddle.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.840
You can't afford to mess with him.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.720
What do you mean?

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.280
Riding horses and hurting people in the street,

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.280
doesn't the yamen care?

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.880
Keep your voice down.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.360
In all of Nanjun,

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.400
no one

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.880
can afford to cross this man.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.960
Who is he?

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.960
Is he the Prefect?

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.320
This man

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.400
is Wang Lie.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.480
He's from a powerful family.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.360
A member of the Wang family.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.600
He controls

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.400
almost half of the pearl trade in Nanjun.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.560
He's also the biggest grain merchant here.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.800
Anyone who offends him

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.160
never ends well.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.440
You dare block my carriage?

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.200
Tired of living?

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.000
Lowborn.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.920
Take it and buy yourself a coffin.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.280
Wang family.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.040
Now,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.840
they've set their sights on the proprietress of Lingyun Pearl Shop.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.760
Someone's in trouble again.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.800
Lingyun Pearl Shop

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.520
Young lady,

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.760
your husband

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.720
I'm here.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.440
If you lose again today,

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.760
it's not just this shop

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.440
but you yourself

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.480
will also belong to me.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.400
Young Master Wang, you must be mistaken.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.560
Between us,

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.280
we agreed on best two out of three.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.960
Even if I lose,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.640
it's only the shop at stake.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.360
When did I ever say

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.760
I'd wager myself to you?

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.200
Here in Nanjun,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.720
no woman has ever dared refuse me, Wang Lie.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.560
Being chosen by me

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.960
is a blessing earned from your past life.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.560
This blessing

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.600
Young Master Wang, you should go home

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.240
and leave it for your mother.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.720
You—

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.960
Shopkeeper Shao

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.080
is truly lovely.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.480
And when she speaks,

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.360
she's quite sharp-tongued.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.440
Shopkeeper Wang,

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.040
I wonder if you can win this beauty.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.800
Last time, when we gambled pearls,

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.840
Shopkeeper Shao lost terribly.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.880
Looks like you reject kindness and choose punishment.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:43.760
It's a fair contest.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.120
The loser must accept the result.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.720
Today, Young Master Wang,

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.880
if you beat me,

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.960
this shop

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.360
will be yours.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.000
But if you,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.560
try to seize a woman by force,

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.640
everyone in Nanjun is watching.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.240
If word gets out,

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.680
Young Master Wang,

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.800
are you really above the law?

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.040
Once you lose the shop,

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.520
let's see how tough you act then.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.600
Then,

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.040
let's begin.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.480
In this tray,

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.840
there are three types of pearls.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.920
One is Eastern Pearl,

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.800
one is Hepu Southern Pearl,

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.600
and one is Nanjun Pearl.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.000
If you,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.480
can sort them correctly,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:30.960
I'll admit defeat.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.960
How about it?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.200
They all look the same!

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:38.800
Can't see the shells.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.120
How can you tell them apart?

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.360
Yeah, how do you sort them?

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.120
This Nanjun Pearl—

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.040
it's the new Nanjun Pearl, right?

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.320
That's right.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.160
As everyone knows,

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.160
the new Nanjun Pearl

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.000
looks almost identical to the Hepu Pearl.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.320
They're nearly the same.

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.000
You're trying to cheat.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:07.440
Shopkeeper Wang,

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.280
are you admitting defeat?

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:10.960
Fine.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:13.560
I'll count this round as your win.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.520
But I

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.200
want to bet one more round.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.600
Young Master Wang,

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.960
that's against the rules.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.040
My rules

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:23.880
are the rules.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.800
Doesn't Shopkeeper Shao like to test her eyesight?

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.160
Alright.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.760
Then this round,

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.600
let's compete in observation.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.840
Shopkeeper Shao, please judge these pearls.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.080
Which ones

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.440
are Nanjun Pearls,

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.520
and which ones

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.360
are Hepu Southern Pearls?

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.240
This young lady

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.840
is just hurting herself with her own actions.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.560
That's right.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.760
Miss,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.000
make your choice.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.040
If you admit defeat now,

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.920
and become my concubine,

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.360
not only will I spare your shop,

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.480
but in Nanjun from now on,

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.880
whatever you want,

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.200
I will give it to you.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.200
How about it?

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.920
Morals are truly declining.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.880
Someone dares to treat a lady so rudely.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.880
Oh dear.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.160
And who are you supposed to be?

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.840
Is it your place to speak here?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.200
I am but a humble man,

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.040
under Shopkeeper Shao,

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.840
a foreign pearl appraiser.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.800
Just trying to make a living.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:32.880
Oh.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.400
Leave.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.080
No wonder you keep refusing me.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.680
So,

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.680
you like this kind of outsider.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:43.800
Oh.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.040
Young Master Wang,

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.360
in Central Plains terms,

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:50.000
could it be

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.120
you're jealous?

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:52.640
You...

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.560
Shopkeeper Shao,

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.400
I'm starting the appraisal.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.640
Oh!

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.720
This one

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.520
is from Hepu.

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.560
And this one

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.440
is also from Hepu.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.400
This one,

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.400
this one,

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.480
and this one,

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.480
are all from Hepu.

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.360
This last one,

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.520
I don't even need to say,

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.800
everyone knows

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.840
where it's from.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.800
Say it out loud.

00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.440
Hepu!

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.760
That's right.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.280
Young Master Wang,

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.320
this betrothal gift is so heavy,

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.960
you hauled it over with effort,

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.400
now you have to take it back.

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.040
How exhausting.

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:49.920
Move aside!

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.320
Ouch, Young Master Wang!

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.080
Slow down.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.280
Oh my!

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.960
These pearls...

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.920
Don't want the pearls anymore, Young Master Wang?

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.080
Sorry,

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.200
I'm late.

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.920
Every time I meet a scoundrel,

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:10.400
there's always a gentleman to save me.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.960
Isn't that a coincidence?

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:14.960
And they're all named Wang.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:16.480
Miss,

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.560
when did you meet this foreign gentleman?

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.200
Hmm.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:45.600
What?

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.800
You want me to shut down Lingyun Pearl Shop?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:53.840
Prefect Li,

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.040
closing a pearl shop

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.760
is just a word from you.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.640
Is it so hard?

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.480
Since Lingyun Pearl Shop opened,

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.880
they've followed the rules.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:05.920
Their reputation is excellent.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.680
Why should I shut down their shop?

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:11.720
Because

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.040
I told you to.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:14.840
You...

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:20.720
Prefect Li,

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.120
have you forgotten

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.840
how you became Prefect?

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.040
I

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.080
know what I must do.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.200
Ah!

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:03.960
Ouch, ouch!

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:06.200
Blockhead.

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:08.920
She’s furious.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.560
Young Master.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.040
Sister Rong.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.200
How is she?

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.200
I sent her overseas.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:16.760
It’s safer.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.200
Earlier,

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.720
Sister Rong and I pretended.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.920
We fooled Zhang He.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.480
She told me to take some capital and leave first.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.080
And wait for you to find me.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.040
But...

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.600
It’s been months since we parted.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.000
What I got instead

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.640
was a warrant from the authorities.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:36.960
I thought

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.200
I’d never see Sister Rong

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.720
or you again.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.000
So why are you here?

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:53.960
Before,

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.160
Sister Rong and I

00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:57.000
opened all the collected shells,

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.400
and marked their origins, right?

00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.520
Someone!

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.920
Open all the shells for me!

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.000
Then I found

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.520
the villages under Hepu

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.560
no longer produce pearls.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.360
But the shells from Nanjun

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.680
yield a lot of pearls.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.480
So I deduced

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:13.960
these shells

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.640
must have migrated south.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.000
And arrived in Nanjun.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.120
Impressive.

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.320
It took me so much effort

00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:27.040
just to learn the shells came to Nanjun.

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.560
You already knew.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.320
So good-looking,

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.280
and smart too.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.480
I really regret it.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.400
What do you regret, Young Master?

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.120
Burned the indenture too soon.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.520
It’s not too late to regret now.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:44.440
Xiao Cui.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:45.680
Brush, ink, paper, inkstone.

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.160
Hey!

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:47.920
What’s wrong?

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.320
Young Master, are you scared?

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.080
Coward.

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.440
You...

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.560
So,

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.120
why did you come to Nanjun this time, Young Master?

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:02.840
What’s your plan?

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.520
To catch up.

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:06.200
Make up for our Li family’s

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.920
weakest lesson in Hepu.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.480
No one above us.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:13.360
Li Wenshun.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.280
Li Wenshun.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:15.920
Tell me,

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.120
you traveled so far to be an official,

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.080
what kind of official are you really?

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.280
Called a Prefect,

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.720
but not even a dog in reality.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:31.520
Come.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:35.680
For these rampant villains,

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.360
and the hard times for good officials,

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:40.720
let’s drink.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:51.320
So,

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.000
is this world worse than a dog,

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.200
or is the Prefect worse than a dog?

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:58.800
Who are you?
