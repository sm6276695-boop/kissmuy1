=Episode 14=

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.480
So you named the Young Lord?

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.880
He actually used that name?

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.400
What kind of person is he?

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.080
Is he like his mother?

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.480
I'm not entirely sure about that.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.360
But I heard his mother died
in delivering him.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.960
After his mother's death, his father

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.400
never recovered from grief.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.640
So he cultivated himself in a temple.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.240
I was never close to him.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.040
He never spoke of his mother.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.000
Well then. You can tell him
what I shared with you today

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.000
when you return to the capital.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.440
This is very important to him.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.040
Thank you, A'man.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.320
Actually, that's all I know.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.440
After dinner that night,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.240
my father escorted Princess Anhe away.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.280
So that means

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.480
Princess Anhe's last night in Ningzhou

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.400
was spent with you?

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.016
What happened next?

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.960
Next...

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.280
Oh, right.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.680
The night before she left,

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.360
she said when she returns
to Ningzhou again,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.920
she'll take me, Mu,

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.200
and the Young Lord

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.920
to set off fireworks together.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.000
But as for what happened afterward...

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.160
I truly don't know about it.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.880
Set off fireworks...

00:02:06.784 --> 00:02:09.728

Is it good?

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.360
It's so good.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.920
You have a bite too.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.280
I won't eat any.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.800
These are all for you.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.720
After finishing, when you go back home,

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.000
don't make a fuss
at your grandmother's place, okay?

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.920
What if I could stay with you
for a few days each month

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.080
and eat this delicious brown rice.

00:02:40.352 --> 00:02:43.296

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.000
Lady Ye.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.520
Lord Shen says you may stay
in the west wing temporarily.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.920
It will be repaired soon.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.720
Tomorrow, you...

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.640
Is it ready?

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.320
Not yet?

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.040
I don't know.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.640
Then it's not ready.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.640
Then how about you make do staying
in Lord Shen's heated chamber

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.440
for a few days?

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.520
This will make
tending his wounds easier.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.480
That's fine.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.840
Then I'll trouble Lord Gao

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.720
to deliver Jin's meals.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:31.520
Sure.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.800
Jin's been free these days.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.280
You'll see her soon.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.640
Really?

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.400
I trust you.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.120
I-I'll take this to Jin.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.000
A'man, you must be hungry.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.440
After Gao Fu returns,
I'll take you to eat.

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.680
Okay.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.720
I won't say anything!

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.280
Gao Fu.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.000
My lord.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.280
Any more brains left?

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.720
My lord, the brains...

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.080
There's none left.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.000
I haven't had enough.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.520
What should we do?

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.520
Don't we have three fresh ones here?

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.040
My lord, which one do you want first?

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.760
- That one.
- The one at the edge?

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.760
What are you doing?

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.080
Can't you tell?

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.600
Eating human brains.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.320
- Eating human brains?
- Human brains?

00:04:46.304 --> 00:04:47.320
You don't understand?

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.120
Human brains are the tenderest.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.120
Especially fresh from living people.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.840
Gently secure the head like this.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.840
Don't move.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.320
My lord, shouldn't we use
a sharper blade?

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.120
Whatever.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:11.760
As long as it's edible.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.280
Cut slowly along the cranial suture.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.560
The incision must be small.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.640
Pry open a piece of skull

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.280
to reveal the creamy brain.

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.240
Now you have to hold your breath.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.120
I must act
while the brain's still pulsating,

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.160
scooping it out quickly with a spoon.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:32.840
I'll talk!

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.040
Stop! I'll talk!

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.040
I'll talk!

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.160
He'll tell everything. He won't tell.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.800
- I'll eat his brain.
- Alright then.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.240
No. Stop it.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.800
I'll talk. I'll talk.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:45.120
You'll also talk?

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.240
Immortal Song, they agreed to talk.
What about you?

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.000
I'm just a woman who reads fortunes.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.160
I don't understand
what you're saying, my lord.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.600
Then read the fortune
for yourself and the Lu family.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.240
My lord, this scheme of yours
will come to nothing.

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.760
Within 15 days,

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.680
I'll surely walk free under the sun.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.320
Then I'll offer you a divination.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.320
Sunlight will mean your death.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:30.760
We'll see about that.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.720
I never imagined they'd use
living humans to smuggle pearls.

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.840
Days ago, when I investigated
in the market,

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.520
I heard rumors
of frequent disappearances.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.200
But in Ningzhou,

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.480
pearlers vanishing at sea is common.

00:06:44.704 --> 00:06:46.304
Even the authorities turn a blind eye.

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:48.920
I didn't expect it.

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.040
The Lu family must be involved in this.

00:06:52.544 --> 00:06:53.720
It's time to deal with them.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.760
My lord.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.000
The Lu family are imperial merchants.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.440
We need royal decree
to act against them.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.880
We're overstepping our authority.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.040
I'll draft a memorial
to request the decree.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.080
This won't stop us acting first.

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.840
Take men and surround them first.

00:07:13.536 --> 00:07:14.000
Understood.

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.840
Grandmother.

00:07:40.512 --> 00:07:41.920
The Inner Bureau is investigating.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.200
Resisters will be executed!

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.240
Lord Shen? Weren't you rescuing A'man?

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.600
What is this for?

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:01.080
Just because I rescued someone,
I discovered murderous intentions.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:10.000
The Lu family is suspected
of pearl smuggling with pirates.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.600
From this moment,
during our investigation,

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.840
no Lu family member may leave.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.800
Resisters will be executed.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.320
Slander.

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.600
This is slander.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:22.880
Do you have evidence?

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.120
I am the evidence!

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.280
My lord, please take a seat.

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:31.800
My lord.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.760
My lord,

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.120
I appreciate your daring rescue

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.120
of Concubine Ye from pirates.

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.240
But pirates are desperate criminals.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.760
Their words carry no credibility.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.400
Don't fall for their scheme
to sow discord.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.960
Madam,

00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.720
I never mentioned pirates,

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.120
yet you're already distancing yourself.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.160
My lord,

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.040
we are imperial merchants.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.720
Searching our premises
requires royal decree.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.400
Do you have one?

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:17.640
The decree will arrive within days.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:24.360
Moreover, the Inner Bureau operates
with imperial authority

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:26.520
to act first and report later.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.280
Young man,

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:33.880
your fiery vigor

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.680
may lead to misguided decisions.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.400
Don't say I didn't warn you.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.920
In life and actions,

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.880
one must bear consequences
of impulsiveness.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.160
Then I shall thank you for your warning.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.120
No thanks needed.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.360
You've blocked us in,

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.560
so where's A'man?

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.800
She's at Duting Station.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.760
Again, your family colluded with pirates

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.360
and tried to silence her.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.760
So, as a key witness,

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.240
she needs to be protected first.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.480
Silence her?

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.240
How could it be?

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.800
Master Lu, you know her status
better than I.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.040
Shouldn't your questions
be directed elsewhere?

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:34.320
My lord, since you've made your decision

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.080
I'll press no further.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:40.840
Oh, right. I'm taking Jin with me.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.680
My lord, Jin is part of the Lu family.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.200
Lord Gao just said

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.080
no Lu family member may leave.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.080
Resisters will be executed.

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.000
Jin is my foster daughter.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.200
Moreover, your family registry

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.640
lists no record of her existence.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.360
My lord,

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.520
though her mother's status

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.480
delayed Jin's registration,

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.440
she remains my blood daughter

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.400
and the Lu family's young lady.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.960
Really? Then ask around.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.840
In this Lu family, apart from her mother

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:24.720
and you,

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.240
as for the rest, each and every one,

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.160
who truly cares for Jin?

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:35.000
You couldn't share joys before,

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:40.000
so future hardships
need not be shared, either.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.160
My lord.

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.720
Shi'an, hold your tongue.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.360
He is right.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:51.040
Children naturally cling
to their birth mothers.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.160
Chenghuan,

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.120
take Jin to Lord Shen.

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:57.840
By the way,

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:02.120
bring along her favorite sweets.

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:04.080
Go.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.360
Understood.
