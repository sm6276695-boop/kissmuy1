00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.200
In the end,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.880
is this world worse than a dog,

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.800
or is the Prefect worse than a dog?

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.000
Who are you?

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.400
How dare you break into the Prefect's residence?

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.120
Shouldn't you first ask me

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.360
how I got in?

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.120
Oh, you—

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.600
How did you get in?

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.080
Your Excellency,

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.360
surely you don't think this residence

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.280
truly belongs to you?

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.760
Just give someone a bit of silver,

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.840
and they'll let me pass.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.880
Nonsense!

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.680
Li Wenshun.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.360
Courtesy name: Hongzhi.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.440
From the capital.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.200
Transferred to Nan County as Prefect.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.520
Been in office for over a year.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.840
Accomplished nothing.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.960
Not only sidelined,

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.760
even that mere Wang Lie

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.240
dares to treat the Prefect as nothing.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.080
How pitiful.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.320
Your Excellency,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.360
why not

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.680
sit down and talk?

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.120
You—

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.360
Who are you, really?

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.280
Li Ling.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.320
Oh?

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.000
The Prefect recognizes me.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.000
Your likeness is on the wanted notice.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.200
How could I not know you?

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.720
As the Prefect,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.600
you can remember the faces on wanted notices.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.160
Shows you're a diligent official.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.800
But why does an official,

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.280
even a good one,

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.440
end up in such a state?

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.560
What do you know?

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.680
Hmm.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.760
Those officials,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.160
all collude together.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:51.920
Here in Nan County,

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.160
there's drought or flooding every few days.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.040
Even with Herculean ability,

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.440
what could I possibly do?

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.200
To raise funds for disaster relief,

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.680
I have no choice but to turn to these merchants.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.040
But their money

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.800
is poison that eats away at the bones.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.840
So you just sit here complaining,

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.720
feeling sorry for yourself.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.720
Acting like this,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.760
do you still call yourself a true man?

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.680
How dare you!

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.040
Have you considered why you've ended up like this?

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.840
Why do the rivers always break their banks?

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.640
Why is there never enough food?

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.720
Why are the people always displaced?

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.840
And Wang Lie—

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.080
what gives him the nerve to act so arrogantly?

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.160
Your Excellency,

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.120
if Nan County continues like this,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.040
even your head won't be safe.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.040
Even your family

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.560
will surely be implicated.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.760
When that time comes,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.680
you'll be cursed by thousands,

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.840
branded as a corrupt official.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.840
You came to see me

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.920
just to say all this?

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.120
Your Excellency,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.240
I came

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.520
to help you.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.240
You—

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.520
help me?

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.080
How will you help me?

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.320
I want to act first,

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.080
cut off Wang Lie's pearl supply.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.080
But he controls the grain supply.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.160
If you,

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.800
don't follow his orders,

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.880
he'll surely use food to threaten you.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.920
Then,

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.480
we'll see if you dare to join me

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.120
and take a gamble.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.800
Your Excellency,

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.440
Then I'll take my leave.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.000
Hey, Li Ling.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.480
Why are you helping me?

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:43.560
Your Excellency,

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.640
I'm not helping you.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.280
I'm helping myself.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.880
I want you to pave a way for me.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.200
A way

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.920
that is justifiable

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.200
for me to return to Hepu.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.200
Li Ling,

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.640
did you really kill someone and go on the run?

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.360
I didn't kill anyone.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:17.480
Come, come, come!

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.920
Take a look!

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.800
Come and see!

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.520
Lingyun Pearl Ship!

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.520
Buying at high prices!

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.960
Pearls and sea shells!

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.480
Prices are 20% higher than the market!

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.440
Come, come, come!

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.880
Take a look!

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:27.560
Come and see!

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.840
Please come inside, sir!

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.680
Take a look!

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.400
In a moment,

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.280
I'll pick out all the shells with pearls.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.000
I'll separate them all.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.880
You take the shells without pearls

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.080
and find someone

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.360
to sell them all to Wang Lie's shop.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.720
Young Master,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.040
is this

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.680
really appropriate?

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.920
It's perfect.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.320
Everyone says

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.360
every villain meets his match.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.000
But who is the real villain?

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.400
And who will be the one to deal with them?

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.840
Today,

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.680
I'll show Wang Lie

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.640
what a true villain looks like.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.720
So these are the pearls you bought for me?

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.760
Not a single one.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.560
Get out.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.720
Boss.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.200
These batches should have produced pearls.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.600
They’re all pearl-producing shells.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.120
Why are there no pearls?

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.680
I don’t know either.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.720
You don’t know?

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.280
You know nothing.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.680
Then what use are you to me?

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.840
You made me lose over a hundred thousand coins.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.680
Take him away.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.040
Feed him to the dogs.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.200
Please, Boss, don’t!

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.520
Take his whole family away.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.160
Boss!

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.120
Even if I didn’t succeed, I worked hard, Boss!

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.040
Boss!

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:01.920
Boss!

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.720
Lingyun Pearl Ship wasn’t shut down.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.320
They even got a special permit.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.000
What?

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.200
I asked around.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.720
The Prefect approved it himself.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.720
Li Wenshun.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.520
He dares to go against me.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.560
He’s asking for trouble.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.000
Did we not bribe him enough?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.480
Should we send more money?

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:25.560
Just a beggar from the capital,

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.720
dares to cut off my profits.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.040
Then I’ll

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.680
make Nanjun run out of grain.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.120
Isn’t everyone saying the Sea God is angry?

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.840
That pearls can’t cross Meiling?

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.520
From today on,

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:38.520
grain

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.120
won’t cross Meiling either.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.600
It won’t enter Nanjun.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.480
Why won’t you sell your grain?

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.040
Yeah!

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.040
Hey, I have pearls.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:46.280
I can trade pearls for grain.

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.640
We want to buy grain.

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.720
Give us grain!

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.960
I want to buy grain!

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.200
I said there’s no grain.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:53.880
So there’s no grain.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:58.000
Take one more step,

00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.760
and I’ll kill you.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:02.960
Report!

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.680
Your Excellency.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.720
Wang Lie’s granary has stopped distributing grain.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.360
Open the granary.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:11.280
Release the grain.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:13.680
Next, next!

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:16.080
Come on!

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:16.800
Next, next!

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.040
Next, next!

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.000
Wang Lie has cut off Nanjun’s grain supply.

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:24.000
But the government granary

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.240
won’t last long either.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:28.160
This was all expected.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.440
I cut off Wang Lie’s pearl supply.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.040
And you didn’t shut down Lingyun Pearl Ship.

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.240
He was bound to use grain as leverage.

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.680
Who could have guessed?

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.400
A rumor about pearls not crossing Meiling

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.600
gave him an excuse.

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.600
Claiming grain can’t cross Meiling.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.640
I think it’s him.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.440
He never shipped grain across Meiling.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:51.080
This is partly my fault.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.040
I didn’t think it through.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:53.760
Hey, Li Ling.

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:57.480
Where’s the solution you promised me?

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:00.920
If you go out to sea

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.080
and help me bring back a shipment of grain,

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.680
Why do you need grain?

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.240
The grain you bring back

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.840
should save many people.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.240
Three days.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.560
Within three days,

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.800
I will give the Prefect a satisfactory answer.

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:18.480
Crooked merchant

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.520
You have grain but won't sell

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:20.320
We want grain

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.240
We want grain

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.240
You have grain but refuse to sell

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.640
You crooked merchant

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.280
We'll report you to the Prefect's office

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.320
We want to buy grain

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.600
I have pearls

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.400
Why won't you sell me grain?

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.400
I want to buy grain

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.160
I want to buy grain

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:34.160
I want to buy grain

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:36.840
Boss

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.160
Boss

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:38.960
Boss

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:39.880
If we don't release the grain soon

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:40.920
Those lowly commoners outside

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.240
will start causing trouble

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.600
If the commoners riot

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.280
it's the Prefect's problem

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.520
Not my concern

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.280
The Prefect's grain

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.840
must be running out too

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:55.840
If you calculate

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.080
it should be gone by now

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.000
That little brat

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.480
should be running out of grain soon too

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.960
Once I deal with that clueless Prefect

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.040
I'll pay her a visit

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.880
When the time comes

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.280
give me a bit extra

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.360
give me even more

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.240
Thank you, thank you

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.840
No need to line up in the back

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.120
No more grain today

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:26.680
It's gone

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.480
It's gone

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.200
I said there's none left

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:28.760
No grain left

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:29.640
Stop fighting, stop fighting

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.240
Stop lining up

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:32.040
I told you, there's no grain

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.120
Stop fighting

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.120
Hey, hey

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:38.800
Stop fighting

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:39.880
The Wang family has grain

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.120
Come with me to seize it

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:41.920
Let's go

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.560
Let's go

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.720
Follow me

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.120
Let's go take the Wang family's grain

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:52.520
We want grain

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:53.720
There's grain upstairs

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.160
Let's go grab the grain

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.040
What are you doing?

00:10:59.040 --> 00:10:59.600
Don't move

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.000
What are you doing?

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:02.080
We want grain

00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:08.760
Move aside

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:09.360
Step aside

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:10.560
It's mine

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:15.840
Li Ling

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.760
Three days have passed

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:21.720
Where's the solution you promised?

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:26.720
Your Excellency

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:27.880
Hold on a little longer

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:41.400
I hope I didn't trust the wrong person

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:42.680
Otherwise

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.640
even if I have to remove my official hat

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.760
I'll take you down with me

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:48.720
Report

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:49.520
There's no grain left in the city

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.520
The people are in chaos

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:53.800
Li Ling

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.360
You

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.160
The grain has arrived.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.560
The grain has arrived.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.560
The Prefect cares about the people's needs.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.200
A million bushels of grain are being sold at fair prices.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.800
Acts of looting

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.240
will not be punished.

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.560
Everyone, please line up.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.080
There is enough for everyone.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.760
It's grain, real grain!

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:33.640
Even if life is a bit tough,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.120
as long as the people can eat their fill,

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.360
they won't steal,

00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.280
won't rob,

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.080
won't cause trouble,

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:39.800
and will even pay for grain.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:40.800
Lord Li,

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.360
do you understand now?

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.680
The people's demands

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.120
have never been high.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.400
On behalf of the people of Nan County,

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:48.840
I thank you.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.160
The people of Nan County

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.200
are fortunate to have Lord Li.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.560
This time,

00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.920
you didn't let me make any money again.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.680
Isn't there something more important than making money?

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.280
Look,

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:02.160
are you happy?

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.400
Thank you, thank you.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.040
Thank you, my Lord.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.160
Thank you, my Lord, for coming to save us.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.840
Thank you, my Lord, for saving us.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:14.720
Thank you, my Lord.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:16.680
Thank you, my Lord.

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.840
It seems so.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.480
This feels better than earning money.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.240
Oh, right—

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.800
How is Rong'er?

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.440
Wait till she returns,

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.720
she'll definitely surprise you.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.000
I'll go help out first.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.920
There's still plenty of grain on the boat.
