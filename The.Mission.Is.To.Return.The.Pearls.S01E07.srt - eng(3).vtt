00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.640
Throw.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.880
Stop.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.880
Got money or not?

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.000
I have no money.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.560
Continue.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.760
Stop.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.960
Got money or not?

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.800
I really don’t have any money.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.160
This...

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.960
I’ve squandered all the Li family’s fortune.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.040
Who doesn’t know that?

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.280
I’ll ask you one last time.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.160
If you don’t have money,

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.200
you’ll be fish food.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.600
I-I have money.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.760
I don’t have money right now.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.720
But I will have money.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.640
Alright, alright.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.320
You, Li family and Jia family, joined forces.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.120
At thirty percent of the price.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.400
You bought all the pearls from Wang’s shop.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.880
You bought all their pearls.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.560
With this,

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.840
your Li family dominates Hepu’s pearl trade.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.120
You’re the only big player now.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.360
Now,

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.080
you still claim you have no money?

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.440
I do, I do, I do!

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.320
I have money.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.200
Then tell me,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.800
how are you rich?

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.040
I have pearls.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.560
I have them.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.720
I have pearls.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.160
Ordinary pearls

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.840
don’t interest me.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.480
I only want premium ones.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.800
They’re all premium.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.000
You really have premium pearls?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.160
You’re just making things up.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.720
The pearls from Hepu these days

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.880
are getting worse and worse.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.760
How can you offer me premium pearls?

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.400
My Li family has been in pearls for generations.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.200
Others may not know,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.920
but my family has plenty of premium pearls.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.840
Wait a moment.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.960
Pull me up!

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.840
Look,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.080
he can’t hold on anymore.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.520
Hurry and pull me up!

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.120
Hey!

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.440
Kawu.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.120
Yes.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.040
Eh?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.480
Did you find him?

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.920
No.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.960
The young master is nowhere to be found.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.000
What should we do?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.080
I searched so hard.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.800
I’ve looked everywhere.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.840
But he’s just not here.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.160
Where could he have gone, tell me?

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.760
I even checked under the flowerpots.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.920
Went behind the rockery too.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.880
Even checked the bun shop.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.160
The world’s so big, so many people.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.640
How can we find him?

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:31.320
Make way.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.960
Young master.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:32.600
Li Ling.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.520
Why are you here?

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.640
Why wouldn’t I be here?

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:36.720
Li Ling.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.600
Where did you go?

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.640
Why are you only back now?

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.400
Don’t mention it.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.240
I got kidnapped.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:42.520
Young master.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.000
I...

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.560
I know about your joint shell collection.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.080
These are the shells we collected this time.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.760
We opened some.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.720
But...

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.320
The pearl yield is extremely low.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.040
Ah.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.720
Hmm.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.080
With such a low pearl yield,

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.520
it’s not even twenty percent.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.040
Someone!

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.400
Open all the shells for me.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.960
Come on, come on.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.120
These pearls of ours

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.240
come from those pearl households

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.040
using inferior shells

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.600
Are they just mixing fake pearls in?

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.200
Probably not

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.840
But there have been rumors lately

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.960
that shells from all Hepu villages

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.120
have sharply decreased in pearl yield

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.080
and the quality of pearls is much worse than before

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.800
So that's what's going on

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.160
If the pearl yield wasn't so low

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.240
these pearl households

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.480
would never have agreed

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.000
to sell at thirty percent of the usual price

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.480
Given the current situation

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.480
even if we

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.640
calculate with triple the pearl yield

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.760
when settling accounts with the pearl households

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.400
even if we give up ten percent

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.800
we'd still suffer heavy losses

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.200
Young master

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.480
Should we stop collecting shells for now?

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.760
It's fine

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.240
As long as we can still get pearls

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.960
and sell pearls

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.920
what you’re worried about won’t happen

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.360
But

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.520
where will the pearls come from?

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.520
If Li family's pearls aren't enough

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.000
then we'll use all the pearls from Hepu to make up for it

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.640
This started because of me

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.680
What comes next

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.000
leave it to me

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.920
Stop eating

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.760
Hurry, keep up

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.200
Keep up

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.360
Young master

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.760
You’re something, Li Ling

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.640
You still haven’t paid me back

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.200
and now you want to borrow my clothes

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.600
Aren’t I stylish?

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.280
It’s my clothes that look good

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.280
I’m going to get some pearls

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.120
Premium ones

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.200
Interested?

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.200
Come with me

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.200
Have you noticed

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.360
that this shop’s pearls

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.720
are getting fewer and fewer lately?

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.880
Don’t talk nonsense

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.720
I run an honest business

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.200
But lately

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.480
the pearl yield from the shells

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.560
has been dropping

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.880
We’re at a loss too

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.160
If this keeps up

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.960
the jewelry trade in Hepu

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.200
won’t be able to continue

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:19.320
Boss

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.320
I’ll open one

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.680
Excuse me, excuse me

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.960
Knife

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.640
What are you staring at?

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.360
Pay up

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.240
You opened it for free?

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.240
Hurry, hurry

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.160
Here, boss

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.560
Alright

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.040
Let’s see what he gets

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.200
Hey

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.840
Whoa

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.760
So good

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.480
He really found one

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.520
He actually got it

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.200
Is his luck really that good?

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.280
Boss

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.360
Give me a few more

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.520
Give me a few

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.440
Where are you going?

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.920
Not opening anymore

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.000
Pack them all up

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.680
Take them away

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.480
Load them up

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.440
Why are you leaving?

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.480
I’ve already picked out all the shells with pearls

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.560
I’ve sorted them all

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.120
No

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:34.800
Let’s go, hurry

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.840
Where are you going?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.080
To the next shop

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.160
Let’s go

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.360
This is the one

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.000
Get out, get out, get out.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:58.960
Where did these barbarians come from?

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.240
You took all the good pearls.

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:00.680
Come again,

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.400
and I’ll break your legs.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.120
Hey!

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.920
Believe it or not, I’ll smash your shop.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.640
No, no, no, no, no!

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.480
We need another way.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.560
You’re something, Li Ling.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.520
Shh.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.400
So you wore my tribe’s clothes

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.400
just to use us as a shield, right?

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:19.880
Listen to yourself.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.840
If they find out I took the pearls,

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.160
how will I survive in Hepu?

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:23.880
What are you thinking?

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:24.280
Tch.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.080
No,

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.240
I need to survive too.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:28.880
Sis,

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.680
should we call a couple more people?

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.040
Here, here.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.240
Take it.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.440
Take, take, take this.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.280
Sis, slow down.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.680
That looked like the young master just now.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:40.480
Young—

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.480
That makes no sense.

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.320
The young master isn’t into that kind of thing.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.440
Young master!

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Where are you, young master?

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:56.960
Yes.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.160
No.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.440
Yes.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.080
No.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:11.960
Yes.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:13.760
No.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.400
Yes.

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:16.960
No.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.120
Yes.

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.040
No.

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:19.800
Yes.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.680
No.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.480
Yes.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.400
Meow.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.240
Yes.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:23.760
No.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.320
All the shells bought from Hepu today—

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.280
if even one doesn’t yield a pearl,

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:32.200
they’re all yours.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.800
Wow.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.000
How do you have all of them?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.200
How did you manage that?

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.560
Family secret technique.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:16.640
Don’t pry around.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.160
You’re telling me all this,

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.000
aren’t you afraid I’ll take you away?

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.840
I trust Miss Kana.

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.480
She’s not someone short-sighted.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.800
Just these few pearls

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.800
aren’t even a tenth

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.520
of what we supplied to the court in previous years.

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:31.800
Besides, what Miss Kana and I want to do

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.120
is much bigger than this.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.040
Hey.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.600
I’m not getting involved

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.440
in your business with the governor’s office.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.440
You Han people have a saying,

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.800
“The people do not fight with officials.”

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.520
But in my view,

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.360
merchants are even less likely to fight with officials.

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.160
Because we can’t win.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.200
May I ask, Miss Kana,

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.760
what kind of business did you do with Manager Wang before?

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.680
We did anything that made money.

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:58.320
Grain,

00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.360
pearls,

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.440
silk and porcelain.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.320
Yeah.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.600
If there’s profit, we do it.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.360
Isn’t the porcelain and silk business

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.640
hard to get into?

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.560
Yeah.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.600
Even though your emperor issued a decree

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.760
allowing us to trade with Han people,

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.080
all the good stuff

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:17.160
is monopolized by a few big families.

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.360
If we want to buy,

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.040
we have to pay high prices and buy secretly.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:24.920
My Li family

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.280
has been in business for generations.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.640
Our trade routes in the Central Plains are extensive.

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:31.200
Why does Governor Zhang keep targeting me?

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.160
He wants my family’s wealth,

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:35.400
but what he really wants is our trade routes.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.920
If these routes open up,

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.080
the benefits

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.000
will far exceed your imagination.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.520
If you work with me,

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.720
whatever the Central Plains have,

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.960
you’ll have it too.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.240
And in between,

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.680
no one will take a cut.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.840
Are you serious?

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:49.200
Miss Kana,

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.520
you can check for yourself.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.680
Miss Kana,

00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.960
take your time to consider.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:01.640
All the pearls here,

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.160
I’ll give you a twenty percent discount.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.520
What do you want me to do?

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.360
Where did the young master go again?

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.040
If I can’t find him, I’ll get scolded again.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.880
The weather is so clear today.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.600
Everywhere looks beautiful.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.200
Buy one more.

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:30.920
Li Zhong.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.120
Here we go again.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.960
The weather is so clear today.

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.600
Everywhere looks beautiful.

00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:52.960
Young Master Li is awake.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.680
Zhang Ji.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:56.520
Me.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:57.880
Why is it you?

00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.640
Me.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:02.120
You.

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.400
Why are you here?
